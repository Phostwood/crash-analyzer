‚úÖVersion 1.21.1 is now live:
https://phostwood.github.io/crash-analyzer/

1. ‚úÖClarified (in code and English troubleshooting steps) that usvfs_x64.dll in sections.topQuarter (First line, Possible relevant objects (Net Script Framework only), and/or Probable Callstack) equates to a high-likelihood of the crash being caused by Antivirus Software. NOTE: this probably also includes a theoretical bugfix, since previously it set specifically to sections.probableCallstack ... which seems overly restricted.

2. ‚úÖ‚ùì Possible Texture Issue Indicators Found: Fixed small bug where "Detected indicators:" were mistakenly labeled as "Mentioned texture files:" 

3. ‚úÖAdded "Phostwood's " to both HTML page <title> tags ... for better branding, and better discord links

4. ‚úÖ‚ùì BGSSaveLoadManager Issue Detected: updated Jerilith's list his new 2025 version



--- Upcoming version ideas ---

1. New test: MCO and BFCO incompatibility
	https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1ikensd/bow_rapid_combo_v3_tpose/
	Iyzik:
	"MCO and BFCO installed. Idk if that would affect the main bow attack, but those two aren‚Äôt compatible and do the same thing (more or less)."
	"u/Phostwood I‚Äôve seen this a few times recently, where people have both MCO and BFCO installed. It doesn‚Äôt cause crashes usually, but might still be a helpful note for your analyzer to mention if both DLL‚Äôs are present? Just an idea‚Ä¶"
	‚≠êÔ∏èBe sure to add Iyzik the Thank You list!

2. Also from Iyzik: New Wheeler test
	- https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1ikvl0y/can_someone_help_a_noob_decipher_their_crashlog/
	- If Engine Fixes already installed
	- If Wheeler shows up in sections.topQuarter
	- then recommend mod that reportedly fixes some issues in Wheeler:
		- https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132074
		- display in Advanced Section, probably under "Mod-specific Issues" for now
	- test log: needs wheeler fix mod - firstLine wheeler-dll - user Iyzik - wdNX4usA.txt


1. Update Safe Save Guidelines in Analyzer:
	- https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/1337142624821182547
	- also, update/edit my original reddit post
		- https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1hntsnl/thoughts_on_jeriliths_safe_save_guide/
			- also share Nolvus Discord invite so they can read the rationales?
	- ‚úÖ‚ùì BGSSaveLoadManager Issue Detected:
	- other listings?

1. Consider merging these two tests:
	- ‚ùì CompressedArchiveStream Issue Detected:
	- ‚ùì Possible Texture Issue Indicators Found:
	- In this log ... they both repeat a lot?
		- isolated texture - D6DDDA - Lorerim - crash-2025-02-08-22-04-10.log

1. Consider no longer emphasizing Memory issue for D6DDDA? It's kind of a repeat of what it already says above it the D6DDDA issue, but might overly steer users towards memory issues instead of texture issues?


2. New DbSkseFunctions.dll crash? (see notes)

3. XP Skeleton mod issue not listed in analyzer's report (see recent Reddit reply)
   - https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1ihfoxi/need_help_reading_crash_log/
   - "Found out it was a problem with XP32 skeleton extended. I didn't download some of the requirements (Optimized scripts and payprus script fix ) but now everything is working fine."

‚ùå‚è∏Ô∏èCould anyone help me see if we can reproduce this potential fix for  DLAA Incompatibility KERNELBASE Crash?
	From Domocles:
	"For DLSS and windows 11 24H2 crash, look like "Nvidia HDR" and/or "Nvidia low latency mode" in the Nvidia app 3D graphic settings have something to do with that. I managed to make  ENB Anti-Aliasing - AMD FSR 3.1 - NVIDIA DLAA works by disabling both"
	https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/1168063977029382235/1337068256564871198


1. ‚è∏Ô∏èPause for FormIDs: New test: levelList crash (see notes)


3. ‚è∏Ô∏èPAUSE FOR FEEDBACK: New Bad Mods list for presumably abandoned mods that are currently known for causing issues. Usually it would be advised to use an alternative to this/these mod(s):
	- thanks wankingskeever!
	- Climates of Tamriel: https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1igbdfl/game_keeps_crashing_whenever_i_leave_the_helgen/
		- second instance (withing a day or two?): https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1id7gqa/game_crashes_sometimes_when_i_fast_travel/
		- newest version I could find: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31978?tab=description
		- indicator showed up in 34 files in my library: ClimatesOfTamriel.esp


4. ‚è∏Ô∏è New features derived from LOOT?


1. Explain how textures can cause issues?
wankingskeever:
https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/s/lqCVJga1K5
‚Äú
D6DDDA

Means one of these:

1.	‚Å†Running out of system memory. You should increase your page files
2.	‚Å†Bad texture. Incorrect dimensions, corrupt file
3.	‚Å†Incorrectly configured texture sets in a mod

‚Äú

2. Two or three new ideas shared with me by wankingskeever as replies on r/SkyrimMods




--- Next version ---



0. New SKSE issues test:
	- instructions like bottom half of VCRUNTIME
	- expand upon scriptIssues in crashInidacatorsMap.js
	- see notepad++ "new45" for a stripped down list of potential files to look for (from explainersMap)
	- https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1idt6bk/skyrim_se_ctd_when_durnehviir_uses_shout_during/
	- see notes on New DbSkseFunctions.dll crash ... which should also be an indicator?
	- These indicators might only be relevant if first-line indicators?
	- What indicators?


2. Mention long covid on my profiles? And make sure all profiles all cross-link:
	- GitHub
	- Ko-fi
	- Patreon
	- Reddit
	- Discord


--- HOLDING OFF FOR 300 to 400 users per day ... and likely only if Ko-fi isn't successful  ---

‚úÖVersion 1.x:
https://phostwood.github.io/crash-analyzer/


#The Great Monetization?

1  Banner ads directly after that!  :-)
   - Banner free for Nolvus Discord Helpers should be doable!
      - https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/gq3e6pKpmhc2DsB5X3d81
	  - still need to figure out a way for Roma and MaskPlague and Krispyroll though ... maybe make my own Discord for the analyzer and make user rolls for them once they sign in?
   - Need to find the best, high-paying, but never unethical banner ad service. No popups. No fake user interfaces. Either targeted ads or like video game or generic ads. Nothing not safe for work. Must be truly mobile friendly. Small banners at top and bottom if mobile. If good screen resolution then feel free to put larger vertical ads on the side. Needs to be easy to use in JS/HTML web aps hosted on GitHub Pages. American or European Union based. Must be a big, ethical-ish company (or at least one that everyone is forced to use anyway).
2. Code to disable banners for Nolvus Discord Helpers
3. Create my own Phostwood Crash Log Analyzer Discord, with a group called Helpers. And offer to add Roma, and Krispyroll, and Mask
4. Paypal and KoFi buttons
5. Patreon subscribers get no ads (currently none of these, so a lower priority)
6. KoFi subscribers get no ads to, if possible?





--- NOTES on SHELVED nested üîéFiles/Elements with FormIDs: ---

1. (potentially) Files/Elements list now includes safer-to-remove FormIDs
	- ‚úÖFIXED?‚ùóISSUE: misses some of the named elements ... this is the biggest issue‚ùó
		- ‚úÖFIXED?the old version didn't miss any...
		- ‚úÖFIXED?the new version misses some that are caught by the old version and by Texture/Mesh Issues
		- ‚ùìI do see more of the x -> y -> z stuff in the old version, but I'm not sure I care? Has that ever been useful?
	- ‚úÖFIXED? ISSUE: adds ` after some of the matches with FormIDs?
	- ‚úÖFIXED? ISSUE: duplicates some of the lines?
	- ISSUE: truncates some really long lines in wrong direction (but do this afterwards ... maybe even next version)
2. (pending step 1 above) Add instructions to Pathing issue for deleting FormIDs
	- see long notes below (search for FormIDs) and in GK notes
	- Perhaps word the item under Pathing/Navmesh Issue something like this:

"As a hack, with at least some theoretical risk, consider using ReSaver [show download and instruction links too] to delete FormIDs found in the üîé Files/Elements section of this report. NOTE: those beginning with '0xFF" should be safer to delete, because they are generic and randomly spawned specific to that save." 

"Form IDs that start with 0xFF are generated dynamically at run time which means that the NPC is generic and that Form ID is specific to that save." - MaskPlague

<li>Consider using save cleaning tools to remove orphaned scripts and other potential corruption. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76776">FallrimTools ReSaver</a> can sometimes fix corrupted save files. See also these <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/s/fbMRv343vm">instructions by Krispyroll</a> and more information in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1d0r0f0/reading_crash_logs/##:~:text=Resaver">Krispyroll's Reading Crash Logs Guide</a>. NOTE: Always keep backups of your saves before attempting fixes or using cleaning tools.</li>



--- Future 1.x Version ---

6. Catch up on on TestLogs (from at least one if not from a couple prior versions?)
	- ‚úÖBaseform: null (?) for NSF Test Log
	- 

2. Review Crash Log Library and try to classify everything

--- next version ---

- Line truncating fix:  when truncating a line with <-- it makes sense to truncate at the end (current behavior), but for --> arrows, it should truncate keep the last 1,000 characters ... not the first 1,000

- POSSIBLE BUG where sections.topHalf doesn't include "stack" for NSF logs?

‚û°Ô∏è4. Consider loosening up regexes in extractNifPathsToListItems and TEXTURE and ANIMATION versions to allow other word delimiters via looser regex

	- NEEDS THOROUGH TESTING

	- Speed Optimization? Consider making a new log sections called allFilesInTopHalf and allFilesInBottomHalf. And from there, when I want a file, just search it? However, the list wouldn't contain any information about what section it was found in....


--- for future versions ---

3. New sections. variables for:
	- sections.RamTotal		    (CLSSE or Trainwreck?)
	- sections.RamUsed			(CLSSE or Trainwreck?)
	- sections.VramTotal		(CLSSE only?)
	- sections.VramUsed			(CLSSE only?)
	- sections.PagefileTotal	(Trainwreck only?)
	- sections.PagefileUsed		(Trainwreck only?)
	- CPU check (towards telling about the microcode update for Intel)


	- NOTE: decided to put these into Sections. variables instead of Utils.? I think I could then pass just Sections.Head to the above extractions, which would make them faster and possibly more accurate...
	- Create new high priority Memory Issues section for Diagnoses section of report (see GK note)
	- Consider making the existing Memory Issues troubleshooting steps de-emphasize RAM and stuff if there is plenty of it in there?



3. New "Low on Memory" test
    - as a new indicator for memory issues
	- new line in log summary
	- report back to Krispyroll when done, and for his review of its troubleshooting text




1. Review overlaps between Animations and Animation Loader tests. Consider reducing the overlap.

2. Consider adding System Management section (from D6DDDA issue or other?) to the "No highest0-confidence indictors found" suggestions? OR just leave that to a upcoming memory issues test?

1. New test to recommend deleting FormIDs with ReSaver:
https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1hufzrw/instability_out_of_nowhere/
- seek out replies from Krispyroll, MaskPlague, and RomatebitegeL

	- "Form IDs that start with 0xFF are generated dynamically at run time which means that the NPC is generic and that Form ID is specific to that save." - MaskPlague
	
	- Possible mod idea? https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136456
		- Doesn't allow editing, but to a technical-ish person it would probably help find a navmesh issue and isolate the mod responsible for it

	- Criticism about adding it:  https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/1168063977029382235/1326898286115688518

--


1. Trim down and tone down Jerilith's rules

2. Removed ‚Äúunlikely cause‚Äù when named elements are included in the list (already removed when files are in the list)

5. KERNELBASE functions with short and long versions.
	- Long version needs to have Nolvus-only instructions injected into main instructions
	- consider isolating "Apply Order" and "Reinstall Nolvus" instructions into reusable code to be shared across multiple tests
	- make sure all instructions are reconciled between Nolvus and non-Nolvus versions

6. KERNELBASE JSON Crash Detected: does the guide need to include the other configuration recommended by Roma?

7. De-Nolvus-ify ENB issue? Unless there are already two versions? And turn it into a function so it isn't so confusing to maintain. Also separate reusable code for reinstalling Nolvus (or not if I'm just linking to google doc?).



--- COMING SOON! ---





---
‚û°Ô∏è = unable to test before going live?
‚¨áÔ∏è = downgraded and added to TODO List
‚úÖ = tested and done (may have multiple levels of checkmarks depending on complexity of overall version)
---


?. Add to "no issues found":
	- text version of Safe Save Rules (with a reference link?)
	- set Windows Pagefile
	- SSD free space
	- Verify some frequently-incorrect settings ... use BGSSaveLoadManager stuff for much of this
	- Some crash logs provide more meaningful indicators than others. Try seeing if the crash repeats with the same diagnoses here, and in the Advanced Users section. 





NEXT VERSION: WORKING ON:???

	- make some tests adjust location in report, based on its isHighPriority flag. Texture/Mesh/Animation issues should be listed higher in the report if possibly relevant files were found, and lower if not found.
		- Maybe get rid of the "Memory and Image-related Issues:" section? If isHighPriority then put into "Higher-Confidence Test Results:" section, otherwise, put into "Miscellaneous Issues:" or perhaps a new "Less Likely Issues:" section?

	- If Mesh and/or Texture (and Animation?) sections are also present (and with supporting files listed), then provide links to those related test sections as often being possible/probable causes of memory issues

    - Add instructions somewhere for finding specific mods/files? Something like: "You can search for mentioned files in MO2 or in your Windows File Manager. Once isolated to a specific mod you can try disabling the mod for a quick test. Or for Mesh and Texture Issue sections of the report: In some cases simply re-downloading and reinstalling the mod with a bad mesh or texture, may fix the corrupted file and resolve the issue."

	- uniformly across appropriate test results, mention NifScan, SSE NIF Optimizer, and CAO for fixing meshes textures
	- üéØ (target emoji) doesn't seem to show up right on PC Chrome ... maybe remove them with the click-to-copy function?
		- However, this one (pasted into Notepad, and then into Reddit markup) works just fine?
			- https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1hl53vl/comment/m3lq7k0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
	- Navmesh/path test(s)? Do they troubleshoot the same?




Bug fixes/updates for Nolvus
Wording improvements and such for Nolvus
Banner ads for Nolvus version
Banner ads disabled for Patreons (if any active paid subscribers, otherwise do after Discord Helpers)
Banner ads disabled for Nolvus Discord Helpers (if this is something the Discord API allows?) ... otherwise a shared-but-secret login (if abused, I'll disable)


CombatMusicFix_NG.dll. version check
Bad version 1
Fixed version 1.1
CombatMusicFix_NG.dll crashes.
Replace it with this working version instead:
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110459?tab=files
What version  is the replacement (1.1) show up as?

Source:
https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/s/YuWn9nc57t


1. ??? Remove STEAM from Overlay checks ... it just comes up too much

2. Does "List of mentioned meshes" reflect named and filename meshes from all mesh indicators? It probably should?
	- same for Utils.extractHkxPathsToListItems() ... it should also check all Animation Indicators
	- same for Utils.extractSkyrimTexturePathsToListItems ??


IN PROGRESS: 
Final steps:
- Update version number
- Review DIFFs for all changed files
- Final round of standard new version tests
- PUSH! Enough features for one version!

- Remove mentions of Nolvus from Skyrim.html version


Next:

See Google Keep notes on:
- new Animations test
- Add test for po3_PapyrusExtender version in CL/TW
	- add new function to get version number of a mod (where available)
	- refactor ConsoleUtilSSE version check code with the new function as well
- Adjust shadow description

- merge animation tests (old one into new one, with hexcode in the map)?

- for D6DDDA  test, it mentions broken meshes as a possible cause, but it doesn't list the new troubleshooting steps. Perhaps instead of rehashing them, tell them to look for the Mesh Issue description in the Advance User section for details.
	- mentioned twice? in normal and Advanced User sections?


- feasible to rewrite Named Elements section (again) to show ownership of named elements by specific files (where indicated by the log)?
	- could also same feature to list of meshes and textures reported on in various tests

- Update version number
- PUSH! Enough features for one version!

---


NEXT Version: Utils.extractNifPathsToListItems() might need to be updated with name1Regex and name2Regex values that are compatible with the syntaxes in CrashLogger or Trainwreck logs?

NEXT VERSION: For Skyrim.html, upgrade the Advanced User's High-Confidence insights into the upper, Diagnoses section of the page
	- Will probably need to wrap them in functions
	- Also, perhaps move them to a different JS file? Maybe diagnoses.js?
	- or maybe wait to do this with the big diagnoses refactoring with test data being extrapolated into data objects?
		- or maybe some tests can't be extrapolated into data objects ... making them into functions in diagnoses.js might be a good place to start at least?

NEXT VERSION: Named Elements section has some differences between NSF and CrashLogger logs. Make them match up, or at least map out why each difference exists.

NEXT VERSION: Alphabetized Load Order Test: Standard, vanilla Nolvus is almost 64% alphabetized by this metric ... perhaps it should include ESM and ESL files to decrease that number and make it a more universally useful metric across other modlists? Theoretically, I think I'd rather have the threshold set from current 70% down to like 50%?

- ‚úÖ Shorten LOOT section in Missing Masters test

‚úÖ~‚úÖ NEXT Version: GraveLord issue isn't showing up in Trainwreck Test Log? Check number of diagnoses from al three log types and make them all match up with the same test results.

‚úÖ Merge mesh issues into one (or two) tests. See in code temporary notes in comment under "General Mesh Issues" List the nifscan tool as mentioned in r/Skyrim's wiki, and already used in hair test. Also, mention "nif optimizer"
	- Most common cause is a faulty mesh that appears in that location. Confirm that all meshes are good by running them through nifscan, which may also isolate a bad mesh to a specific mod. If any are not ported you probably can fix them with "nif optimizer" or CAO
	- Can also search log for found names/filenames for meshes and try to isolate them to a specific mod. If found, you can then try disabling that mod to see if it fixes your issue.

BUGS?


- PAUSE: Why does this say Customized, but doesn't list any non-nolvus mods?
	-	BetterThirdPersonSelection - Crash_2024_4_24_13-16-36.txt
	- I'm guess they removed some vanilla mods?
	- LIKELY: Or, since they have zero extras installed, maybe my test is off?
	- rewrite BGSSaveLoadManager description to be useful, include save cleaning tool link, and don't recommend doing command kill and then potentially continuing on from a save (which could  make it worse)
	- On analyzeLog.js:   "// Check for Nolvus or Nolvus-like modlist" section, either expand the list of mods to test for, or don't make it sound so much like it's mostly Nolvus mods. (Should either be made more complex, or simplified)

- NEXT VERSION (Unused anyway): sections.Plugins isn't grabbing the right data from an applicable NSF log. In this example, it should grab just "2", but is instead grabbing "Plugin_Name: Version 1.0\nPlugin_Name: Version 1.0" ... which curiously, doesn't seem to exist in the log?

- REFACTOR: composite sections so they are just section numbers mapping to sectionMap, and make a special function to loop through the specified section numbers to search through sections of sectionsMap, and return the match along with the section number it was found in.

- REFACTOR: remove section content from sections? Only use sectionsMap?

- REFACTOR: move all log flags/identifiers into either sections or sectionsMap?
	- sections.isSkyrimPage
	- sections.hasSkyrimAE
	- sections.isNolvus
	- sections.logType
	- others?

1. SKIP or PAUSE: Skyrim Crash Analyzer probably shouldn't show any diagnoses ... just advanced user stuff?

1.2 If named elements are from the same line of a crash log, then somehow the list should reflect that. Maybe indentation? Or mabye "firstItem --> secondItem --> thirdItem"?
	- Maybe collect the lines into an array of arrays? With line number in the first array, and then numbered matches as the second array?
		- However, I think that would necessitate parsing each line differently. Currently, I'm scraping file extensions from a line, and then scraping File: and Name: from the same line ... loosing their relative order (if within the same line)


2. "You can only have one Crash Logger active at a time including NetScriptFramework (disable crash dumps in the config). If you're using NetScriptFramework, it's probably the better logger still unless you need PDB support."
	- source: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818
	- Test for which version of Skyrim is being used, looking for either of these lines:
		- Crash Logger Line 1 (0):  Skyrim SSE v1.5.97
		- NSF Line 8 (7): ApplicationName: SkyrimSE.exe
		- If not AE, then recommend NSF instead of Crash Logger
		- If AE, then recommend Crash Logger instead of NSF
	- Improve the hasSkyrimAE flag to be more accurate with check described above
	- If possible, test for multiple crash logger mods, and list them, and recommend disabling all but hte right one


- - - PAUSE - - -
1. New version of Potentially Misorganized Nolvus Plugins test:
	- A. a version worded for non-Nolvus users for ideas on how to organize their plugins
	- B. Show how far each plugin is out of order relative to what other vanilla plugins, and which vanilla plugins it expects to be above/below it
		- indicate like:  mod name.esp (out of order by 3, typically located below X and above Y)
	- C. Show what plugins it expects to be above/below it (to help manually fix the order)
	- maybe indicate extra info through "i" emoji that user can hover over?

0. New issue interface for refactored tests:
	- Hovering over the "i" emoji(s) should show additional information:
		- what indicators the test is looking for
	- Separate descriptions for both Nolvus and non-Nolvus users
	- 

1.1. Kernelbase JSON Crash change:
	- Apparently the go-to fix for this on Nolvus is to edit EngineFixes.toml ... so put #3 as a new #1 so it's the first thing users try.
	- post graphic to r/Nolvus
	- link to graphic from the analyzer
	- related: https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/755346172243214376/1260031303064223884



2. If overlay warning or virus warning is the only thing, then still show no diagnosis found. Perhaps show it if diagnosis count = 0?
4. Add the word "sequence" into Apply Order descriptions and any mention of load order for clarity? 

5. New Skyrim AE Test: ConsoleUtilSSE.dll in Probable call stack --> ConsoleUtilSSE.dll v1.4 is not compatible. Download v1.5.1 instead here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76649?tab=files
