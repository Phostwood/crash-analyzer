✅Version 1.29.1 is now live:
https://phostwood.github.io/crash-analyzer/

1. ❗ Critical First-Line Error Detected:
	- now ignores first-line files that already have better separate tests, or aren't otherwise helpful in diagnoses
	- demotes some less-helpful First-Line Errors to the bottom of the report
	- improved troubleshooting instructions

2. Refactored, reordered in report, and/or tweaked troubleshooting instructions for:
	- ❗ skee64.dll Issue Detected
	- 🎯 NVIDIA Driver Issue Detected
	- ❗ Paid FSR3 Upscaler Issue Detected
	- ❗ KERNELBASE Crash Detected
	- ❗ First-Line Engine Fixes Issue

⭐️AFTER: mention that Silly Angel is now thanked



- - - development notes from this version - - - 

✅FIXED: BUG: firstLine nvgpucomp64 - SKSE AE LOG.txt displays NVIDIA issue twice
❌NotABug: BUG:From Demo: Crash Logger for 1.5.97 is an older version? If so, adjust that test.


✅ Utils:
- Utils.fileExtensions: added .ess files
- THEORETICAL BUG FIX? sections.highestConfidenceIndicators: added sections.firstLine

✅Review the recent Nolvus post

- ✅review all NotePad++ filesearch matches (Crash Logger and Trainwreck)
	- ✅rename all matching crash log filenames with "firstLine SKSE64-dll - " 
- ✅review all currently downloadable versions
	- https://skse.silverlock.org/


0. ✅ 🎯 NVIDIA Driver Issue Detected: 
	- ✅ refactor into modern function
		- ✅ need an example: Dragon's Eye Minimap
	- ✅ use a mapping
	- ✅ add nvgpucomp64.dll to the mapping
	- ✅ any others to add to mapping?
	- ✅ add all mappings to analyzeFirstLine's ignoreFiles in a programmatic way

0. WHILE DOING CODE REVIEW: other changes made to special tests for First-Line Errors that were excluded when First-Line Error Detected

1. ✅❗ Critical First-Line Error Detected: FIrst line exceptions:
	- ✅maybe move them into Advanced Section? ... or do away with them entirely??
		- ✅ANSWER: probably depends on the file
	- ✅ Kernelbase (move to advanced users)
	- skee64.dll (IGNORE LIST ... already has own test)
	- ✅ JContainers64.dll (IGNORE LIST ... already has own test)
	- ✅ EngineFixes.dll (and its other files) (move to advanced users)
		- ✅tbbmalloc.dll (move to advanced users) ... mention from Engine Fixes
			- ✅also d3dx9_42.dll
	- ✅ DbSkseFunctions.dll (move to advanced users) (LATER: create new test showing to review SKSE log file, and look at SKSE-using mods)
	- ✅ ntdll.dll (IGNORE LIST)
	- ✅ VCRUNTIME140.dll (IGNORE LIST)
	- ❌NEW TEST
	 LATER: OpenAnimationReplacer.dll  (maybe create new specialized test? . bump the animation one to the top?)
	- ✅ Revise instructions to emphasize that frameworks are usually NOT directly responsible
	- ❌ DAR? (although I don't see any examples of, and it already recommends switching to OAR)
	- ✅added explainer to the filename
	- ✅test some NSF logs


- Donations section: slightly new look and squeezed it down a bit

- - - Next Version - - - 

0. mention controversy and two schools of thought on configuring Windows Pagefile
	- const verifyWindowsPageFileListItem
	- ⚠️ Low System RAM Detected
		- maybe reuse the const here too?

1. Bug fix from my Discord channel? (or explain why it isn't a bug)

2. Remove first-line for VCRUNTIME ... see reddit post:
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1p8jfv0/tips_for_reading_crash_logs_and_detecting_mods/
	- maybe also remove first-line issue for Kernelbase? Or put it lower down the list when Kernelbase?

3. Move VCRUNTIME recommendation down the list?



5. link to: https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1owwsiq/list_of_testing_and_troubleshooting_tools/
	- Or add the newly discovered tools
		- but also add the poster of this thread to my Thank Yous list


2. Add more info on finding broken meshes and textures. Link to Everything app. Mention MO2. Instructions for checking in xEdit?
	- Advanced Users can use SSEEdit (xEdit) to isolate the source of a specific nif/texture.
	- LINK: https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1oqcipb/comment/nnjz803/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
	- how to? https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/tt5iv0/psa_learn_how_to_use_xedit/
	- meshes
	- textures
	- other?



--- next version ---

10. asked Crash Logger SSE author ... waiting for response.
	- IGNORED: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818?tab=posts&BH=0
	- 20251105

11. Asked J3w3ls ... waiting for response:
	- IGNORED: https://discord.com/channels/872252014002843658/878565217288728576/1435753945468244170




7. Consider adding mini-elements list after highest priority log summary? Only list those with explainers. Maybe call it "Mentioned mods:" or something?


0. Monitor in-game pagefile size and usage

0. Post research question on r/SkyrimMods about recommended Windows Pagefile settings
	- Maybe start with using ProcMon to test Pagefile usage?
	- see Notepad++ txt file with some drafted notes
	- 5. NOTE: Pagefile recommendation is controversial. Many Collection helpers swear by this advice and say they seen it help numerous users. However, some IT/programming types say it's wasted SSD space, and they strongly recommend keeping your pageflies to system managed. If you have the SSD space, perhaps experiment and decide for yourself if expanding your pagefile is helpful. This pagefile recommendation may change if a more decisive determination is eventually made, especially if we can achieve some kind of better consensus between the various Skyrim modding communities.
	- 6. Pagefile should possibly be modernized to recommend 40GB or more, always setting min and max to the same value, about 1GB more than the amount of installed RAM. Theoretically this improves Skyrim stability by preventing a delay in access due to the Pagefile being expanded during especially taxing times.

4. Use line? "Commonalities between multiple crash logs can often be the best indicators of causality"

7. Add filenames checked for regarding overlays. Example: what should I look for to verify Overwolf is no longer there?

8. Get a screenshot of Eagle Eye asking for septims to use in the donation section



---

3. TODO: Update Test Log for the newer tests

⭐️FIX BUG when a second hide menu is closed?

2. ??New version of BGSAutosave test?? with added indicators

3. Fix HTML formatting:
	- ❗ First-Line Engine Fixes Issue:
		- I don't see the issue. Need to record a crash log that triggers this


--- NEXT: IMPORTANT? --

1. TODO: need to improve NetScriptFramework Regex for Stack to allow "{" within its output, instead of prematurely ending it
	- Deemed a separate issue. Largely a performance tweak. "{" is really rare in crash logs
	- OR DELAY? (it seems very rare ... but then the current test would be quite slow running on especially long logs, and the way it is set up, it will always search for the string int he full log)   Bug with variable topHalf with NetScriptFramework?
- Truncated?
- Doesn't show headings? Does it need to?

sections.Stack is being cut short in this log:
"DynDOLODv34 maybe but not GTS - Crash_2025_7_8_0-40-49.txt"

BUT THEN ... who is still using NSF? I'm not saying I don't want to support it, but usage is probably far lower than Crash Logger, and this bug is really rare in NSF...


By this line at the curly braces ... which I'm pretty sure is a rare thing:
[SP+2E0]  0x7FFA51912070     (DynDOLOD.DLL+B2070) (char*) "LargeREFRFix load3d {:08X}"


2. 





--- NEXT VERSIONS: ---


0. Intel has a tool now that can help identify that cpu bug - https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005567/processors.html
	- or maybe it doesn't do that?

1. Missing Master:
	- Added instruction at top:
		- Auto-installing Modlist User: typically this indicates you need to autosort your modlist. Check with your modlist's support for details (Nolvus has an "Apply Sort" button in its desktop. Vortex has a Plugins: Sort button.). Or you could have not installed required Creation Club Content, or have installed other mods via Skyrim's built in mod loader (see below for details).
	- NOTE: See start of new test for this in Claude

2. Missing Masters SSEdit instructions from GTS's Discord:
	- https://discord.com/channels/902984082181484615/1239418241462439936/1239418241462439936
		- might make a good more info link ... best I've seen that doesn't rely on MO2
		- 
	- "P.S. Dwarven Armored Mudcrab and Alternate Armors - Elven Hunter are notorious for not downloading the first time. You might need to open their respective pages on the Creations menu and download from there."
		- at least acknowledge that the CC content sometimes doesn't fully install?

3. Missing Masters again:
	- if your log is cut off and extra short, it could mean you have some sort of save file corruption. Usually you'll need to work backwards trying progressively older saves until one works.



6. "Crashes after reloading saves midgame are unavoidable"

	To prevent this, quit out of Skyrim entirely, then restart and reload.

	Or, to likely-mitigate the  issue, use  "Clean Save Auto-reloader":
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88219

	For a more thorough  approach , try the "Safe Save Helpers"  mod collection.
	https://www.nexusmods.com/games/skyrimspecialedition/collections/4o4jxh/mods

	Also, to prevent  automatically reloading after dying, try a fun  alternate death mod, like  "Shadow of Skyrim - Nemesis and Alternative Death System":
	https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65136


7. Change ticking clock to a dollar bill? Or a begging animation? Change these frequently ... cycle through the best ones...


8. High Memory usage should only be in diagnosis if "suspect"/critical ... otherwise move to Insights section
	- we want to keep those "General Guidelines" showing up....


--- NEXT VERSION: ---

6. ❓ Possible Shader/Lighting Issue:
	- Add info about changing to a smaller screen resolution before playing. Sometimes that can help simplify things and help the hardware to keep up....
	- https://discord.com/channels/902984082181484615/1133753226991255562/1382768070656790608

7. Saving/Loading Issues:
	- Additional indicators for save/loading issues, all found in all three of SpinPigeon's cited example files:
		- BGSSaveLoadManager (existing sole indicator checked in my analyzer for this issue)
		- BGSLoadGameBuffer
		- Win32FileType
		- .ess
		- saveload
		- LoadRequest
		- BSWin32SaveDataSystemUtility
	- Something like this?
		- "Loading a second file (automatically due to death, or manually for any reason) into Skyrim often ends up mixing aspects of your prior game and with the newly loaded save. This is why its a best practice to quit to desktop before loading a second file into a running instance of Skyrim. Because of this, many loading issues can be fixed simply by quitting out of Skyrim, and reloading the desired save"
			- References:
				- GTS
				- Lorerim
				- Nolvus
				- Reddit article someone found when I posted the best practices for review
	- checking list of indicators with SpinPigeon: https://discord.com/channels/902984082181484615/1133753226991255562/1378538268030926858


8. ReSaver: paraphrasing: "WARNING, do not use this to clean your saves automatically, I would recommend this tool only to have a look at what's going on in your save. Cleaning is a destructive process, and should only be done as a last resort!"



--- Next version(s): ---

3. KERNELBASE Crash Detected:
	- "Review the rest of the advice in this report (above and below), and see if there are strong indications of any better-isolated isolated issue. Sometimes other mods/issues can cause a "KERNELBASE Crash". "
		- Add to this: "Missing Masters (see below) can often also cause this issue
		- Maybe move Missing Masters above Kernelbase? Or Kernelbase below Missing Masters?


5. ❓ Animations:
	- "Animation issue makes sense for that crash. I should probably note in my analyzer's info on those that a bad save can cause animation issues (and that often rerunning Nemesis can fix)."
	- https://discord.com/channels/902984082181484615/1133753226991255562/1378393836157538484
	- BUT did SpinPigeon take this back?

1. Repost and fix links to this reddit post:
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/Nolvus/comments/1b041m9/reference_keep_your_active_esmsesps_count_to_254/

1. Sometimes incomplete log files (like where it doesn't even show the REgisters or the Stack) can be fixed by reverting to an old save? 
	- source: https://discord.com/channels/902984082181484615/1133753226991255562/1376200636424650803

1. ❓ Possible dxgi.dll Compatibility Notice:
	- can this be fixed by reinstalling DirectX?

3. Add instructions on checking for missing masters using xEdit? (see FAQ from GTS Discord, or better yet, find a good link on the subject?)


1. Skeleton-only lists should not throw a mesh issue....

3. Some way of emphasizing the first mod in the top quarter of the Stack? Maybe a separate test?

4. Donation Section: Buy me a mead? New mead animated gif?

2. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ New Ostim test suggested in r/Phostwood

4. Link to Safe Save Collection?  https://www.nexusmods.com/games/skyrimspecialedition/collections/4o4jxh

	- Thanks: Ceri; Goolock of Yig, QuietSerpa, and BuccaneerSerpa (Rak!)
		- Mention on GTS Discord?

1. Test for using Oldrim versions instead of SE/AE versions of mods?
https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1kr73bt/skyrim_keeps_crashing_with_exception_access/



1. Enhancement to Files and Elements:  Highlights "(char*)" lines
	- If line contains "(char*)" then skip rest of checks (either showing whole line, or not showing it at all)
		- strip out strings, and if what's left has >2 characters, then display whole line?
			- strip out the identifying "(char*)"
			- strip out "Skyrim.exe" and others skip things like that (there's a list already)
			- then strip out all non-alphabet characters
			- (also strip out white space characters, but they should already be stripped out?) 
			- if >2 characters, show whole string, without anything stripped out

2. New Advanced Users test for "(char*) "SmoothCamMCM"
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1kavpv9/game_crashes_randomly_after_loading/
	- something like RomatebitegeL's: "SmoothCam may be crashing, so disable it and see. If it is responsible, check if you meet the requirements."

0. 🔎 Files/Elements: New feature to list Top-of-the-Stack File(s) (even if already listed in prior sections) 

1. Add note about VRAMr being a possible source of bad textures in the Texture Issues section
	- https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/1354045778217271326/1354110274789052539

2. Add back in some MO2-specific info on textures/meshes:
	- "ʀɪᴠᴜssʏ — 
		Btw to number 1: you can search the nif name directly in the MO2 data tab and it will tell you exactly which mod is the last to modify/include the mesh. A windows explorer search is a painfully inefficient method to find the mesh
		this is also why people advocate to use mo2 because vortex is much harder to troubleshoot / prevent issues with"

0. Redo "Safe Saves" post on r/Nolvus from u/PhostwoodReborn account and update link in analyzer


0. New test from ennui: "CommunityShaders + ENB Incompatibility Detected"
	- "Btw not sure if this is implemented or has much any bearing in crashes but I’d also suggest into searching for ENBHelper.dll + CommunityShader.dll seeing they shouldn’t be together in the first place. Or any .esp/.dll adjacents to them"
	- https://discord.com/channels/872252014002843658/1353034819650453544/1353070541900349583

0. New test and Files/Elements mention of when no .exe or .dll is mentioned in first-line error
	- but what does it narrow down to, if it's outside the scope of Skyrim.exe?

0. Better test for Nolvus v6 from multiple indicators rather than simply a CLSSE log from the Nolvus-side of the analyzer....

0. Possible undiagnosed STRINGS crash for Turkish guy:
	- possible undisagnosed STRINGS crash - message (18).txt
	- possible undisagnosed STRINGS crash - message (19).txt
	- starts here: https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/755346172243214376/1353380157628612690
	- CJ said STRINGS was super common for Turkish players?
	- user: mertgurultuluogullari
	- new v6 install


-- Remove dependency on Internet connectivity: --
	A. https://raw.githubusercontent.com references should be made local

1. Change Skyrim.html's suggestion to use Nolvus version for Nolvus lists is "Nolvus" is found anywhere in the list? Make it softer though, and without a determination of how nolvus-like it is, just offer it as an option.
	- OR make the old version work with Nolvus v6.0.7's new CrashLoggerSSE logs? 


2. BUG FIX. If a prior log loaded, and then content deleted and new log pasted in, it still lists the prior log file's name as the "Loaded file:"

1. ❌ Maybe a survey at bottom of analysis answering "How useful was this analysis to you" on a seven point scale?
	- but I'd be afraid the quick fix results when fixed from a Diagnosis would almost never come back to provide a rating, so the ratings would be very skewed towards being answered only by those with negative experiences....
		- I think usage numbers, and friend referrals and such are probably the best measure of its effectiveness



2. Shorten No Highest Confidence section ... maybe post onto a separate page? Or at bottom? Maybe mostly remove it except for the Nolvus version?

	3. Directly warn against mid-game modlist manipulation anywhere in my analyzer. I've made a note to add that to its "No Highest Confidence" troubleshooting text. Idea inspired by ennui.

1. Issue created when EngineFixes INCORRECTLY installed:
	- https://discord.com/channels/872252014002843658/1350560884300320788/1350560884300320788
	- any way to tell? I don't think so?

2. Add to Engine Fixes install instructions:
	- Q: How do you extract an archive?
to extract an archive simply right click it and select 'extract here' if you are on Windows 11. Otherwise you will need 7zip.
	- source: https://discord.com/channels/872252014002843658/1350560884300320788/1350566928808149113

x. Maybe start with all troubleshooting steps auto-collapsed except for the summary and the indicators (which help to determine which issue is most likely)? Could aid in more quickly skimming and assessing in the same manner that I do?

x. NavMesh/Pathing Issues: maybe add Whiterun Fast Travel fix to Navmesh Issue with a note saying it's specifically for issues in going to Whiterun?


1. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️new test: BSGeometryListCullingProcess test (chat with Blackread)
	- review Blackread's newest thoughts. I think it sounded like when combine with a firstLine error that didn't have .exe or .dll ... then the "CullingProcess" indicators become significant?
		- also, research the correlating code for Skyrim versions after SE
	- MS Copilot:
		- The BSGeometryListCullingProcess is a part of Skyrim's rendering engine, specifically related to the culling process. Culling is a technique used in computer graphics to improve performance by not rendering objects that are not visible to the player. When BSGeometryListCullingProcess appears in a crash log, it typically indicates an issue with the game's rendering process.
		- Here are a few potential causes and solutions:
			- Mods: If you have mods installed, one or more of them might be causing conflicts or issues with the game's rendering process. Try disabling mods one by one to identify the culprit.
			- Graphics Drivers: Outdated or corrupted graphics drivers can cause rendering issues. Make sure your graphics drivers are up to date.
			- Game Files: Corrupted game files can also lead to crashes. Verify the integrity of your game files through the game launcher or Steam.
			- Settings: Sometimes, certain graphics settings can cause issues. Try lowering your graphics settings or disabling specific features like anti-aliasing or shadows.
		- For more detailed analysis, you can use tools like the Skyrim Crash Decoder to help decipher the contents of your crash log and provide more specific insights into the cause of the crash. Additionally, you can check out discussions on forums like Reddit for similar issues and potential solutions.

		current regex for finding these files: (?i)^(?!.*\.(?:dll|exe))(?=.*\bUnhandled\b.*\bexception\b.*\bEXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION\b).+$
			- doesn't seem to work on NSF log files?
				- ^(?!.*\.(?:dll|exe))(?=.*\bUnhandled\b.*\bexception\b.*\b\b).+$


2. Replace hour glass with animated gif clock,or a JS second counter with a green LED readout?



1. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ BUG in Mesh Issues:

	spotted with help from J3w3ls ... be sure to thank them!

	Ok, now I see the BSTriShape  mesh-indicator with the IronClaws_Mtl_B ... right at the top of the Stack (a high-priority location in the log). 

	I'll call this a bug in my analyzer and add it to my to do list. It doesn't currently list meshes like this one unless the log includes the actual filename (not just the name). Well, I think it does for NetScript Framework Logs ... but not for CrashLoggerSSE Logs. I'll try to get that fixed.

	https://discord.com/channels/341090804611285003/341362343273562122/1350189740091113472

	Crash log: "Log 1.txt" and "Log 2.txt" ... I think Log 1 is where the bug is

	Also, reword troubleshooting instructions to include mention of something about the "top of the Stack section"


2. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  Add to Mesh troubleshooting steps something about not using LE mods in SE/AE:
	- J3w3ls again
	- "are you downloading LE mods for SE or something? Because that's a 4th unrelated mesh"
	- https://discord.com/channels/341090804611285003/341362343273562122/1350212634892566631
	- verify the and describe the issue as a troubleshooting line for meshes (and textures maybe?)

3. Another one where my analyzer didn't list a mesh where it probably should have:
	- https://discord.com/channels/872252014002843658/1353034819650453544/1353067720018497639


0. Separated-off for later:  ❗skee64.dll Issue Detected
	- its files list needs to be changed over to the new shared-code way
	- or maybe ditch that code and re-evaluate the shared approach?
		- Are the exceptions making its usage harder?
		- Perhaps more discrete parts can be shared instead?





1. Move skeleton meshes from mesh to animation/XPMSE tests:
	- collect all the variations of skeleton.nif from crash log library
	- Never really is an indicator for Mesh issues
	- Better isolated to the other
	- Remove from Mesh test
	- Add as an indicator for both Animation tests?
	- Add as indicator for XMPSE maybe?

0. Make a new sections.topThirdPlus, and sections.topQuarterPlus and sections.stackTop
	- topThirdPlus includes stackTop
	- stackTop includes either the top 5 lines in the stack, or the top 5% of lines in the stack ... whichever is larger
	- probably replace many of the prior instances of sections.topQuarter and sections.topThird ... and maybe even replace some sections.topHalf with sections.topThirdPlus ?



0. Check out these social medias for Modded Skyrim stuff?
	- Digg is where everyone used to be before they made some bad choices and people went to Reddit.  But they've redesigned and are trying to woo people back.

1. Review log files and resolutions/determinations in Biggie's lorerim-reports channel


2. New test for Likely Physics issue:
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1j18pa7/comment/mg2ka3d/
	- new high-priority indicator:  "HDT Skinned Mesh Physics Ob ject"
	- my library only has 20 files which include this indicator
		- Need to review each of them, but it looks sufficiently rare to be a likely-reliable indicator
	- follow multiple-calls to one function, like used for:
		- function analyzeSkee64Issue(sections, forFirstLine = false) {

0. Consider adding to Recommended Tools:
	- Asset Doctor: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123445

1. Move some old r/Nolvus docs from u/Phostwood into Google Docs for safer storage and sharing

0. Links to consider changing:
	- Link from "graduated from beta" to Discord?
	- Link from modding Nolvus guide from reddit to Customized Nolvus Catalog?
	- other?

2. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Setup a tentative new largely-unused u/PhostwoodReturns user, and make him an emergency moderator on r/Phostwood ... just in case that "technical irregularities" bot on Reddit goes crazy again and suspends u/PhostwoodReborn. (Crazy that I even feel the need to do this. Too much these days is being automated, seemingly without any timely human-adjudicated recourse.)


1. Make a note to NavMesh/Pathing issues that 
	- Thanks Blackread!
	- ME: "I've heard the NPC doesn't even have to be in your same area to be the cause of a NavMesh issue? Some mods apparently will move some NPCs around in different corners of the Skyrim map regardless of where you are at the time? I've never done it, but searching the entirety of Skyrim for navmesh issues sounds like a daunting task?"
	- Blackread: "Yeah, the other navmesh crash was happening fast traveling from Winterhold to Solitude when the actual problem was in Rorikstead. Probably it can even be some newlands mod."
	- others have said this too, but I can't recall who for sure
	- 




2. ❗ <b>Possible Visual C++ Runtime DLL Issue
	- update with patchuli's same new info on dll troubleshooting as used in ❗Critical First-Line Error Detected

1. An system to alert user after they click or engage "Analyze" to alert them that a new version is available. Please either refresh the page if using live, or download the most recent version if using the stand-alone Nexus mod". Maybe in a colored area below the "Analyze" button?






1. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️skyrimcrashdecoder did this one better: DwemerBeardLowerBraidsA - Skyrim crash log (19).txt
	- Probably a FaceGen issue. Could be missing or corrupt FaceGen data or some other NPC face related problem. Possibly related to: Name: "DwemerBeardLowerBraidsA"
	Crash was likely caused by one of the following mods: Skyrim.esm -> Update.esm -> Dragonborn.esm -> unofficial skyrim special edition patch.esp -> LegacyoftheDragonborn.esm -> CollegeOfWinterholdImmersive.esp -> Immersive Encounters.esp
	Probably one of them accessing or clashing with this mod: "immersive encounters.esp".
	The following record might have been involved in the crash: name: "rzalth" formid: 0x00000007.
	To fix the issue, you can try disabling one or more of the mods mentioned above. If the crash still happens, try again with a new log. If you are an advanced Skyrim modder, you can use a tool like SSEEdit to see more information about what record the FormID contains and which mods are accessing it.

1. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Good phrase from skyrimcrashdecoder:
	- "If you are an advanced Skyrim modder, you can use a tool like SSEEdit to see more information about what record the FormID contains and which mods are accessing it."
	- add to it something like: and/or use ReSaver to remove the problematic FormID from your save (although, some may respawn, and others can cause problems when removed)

1. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️skyrimcrashdecoder offers some extra insight into this log:
	- "Probably an issue with an Object Reference (this could be an item or an NPC placed or modified by a mod)."
	- "Crash was likely caused by one of the following mods: Skyrim.esm -> unofficial skyrim special edition patch.esp"
	- "Probably one of them accessing or clashing with this mod: "thenewgentleman.esp"."
	- Crashlog (arjvSyyR).txt




➡️🔎Forms/Elements BUGS: ⬅️
0. Bug where mesh name (file isn't listed by name is) isn't listed in experimental File/Elements (but is in normal version's)
 - source: https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1j26jc8/need_help_game_crashes_when_swinging_weapon_or/
1. ⭐️⭐️⭐️File/Elements bug where skeleton for beast shows up in nifs issue list, but not in Files/Elements?
	- crash-2025-02-28-05-01-12.log
2. Files/Elements (Advanced version under development):
	- ⭐️⭐️Need to make it so multiple FormIDs can show up under one group
		- currently my classic Wolf test doesn't even show the correct FormID to delete
		- already seems to do this for NSF logs?
			- Simplest Horses - Animated Ice Floes - NavMesh-Pathing Issue - Crash_2025_1_16_0-54-34.txt
3. Wrong FormID's attached to object?
	- Crash_2025_2_20_23-12-43.txt
	- v6 Bug 65
	- The hourglass is listing a lot of FormIDs, at lest one of which (the "FF...") doesn't seem to belong to it:

0. Mod(s) with sufficient prominence in crash log get highlighted with a "⭐️" or "➡️" emoji?
	- or maybe add prominence indicators to the end of each line in Files/Elements?
		- Perhaps a checkbox at the top of Files/Elements to add these?

2. ⏸️⭐️New test: levelList crash (see notes)

	https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/s/vbsk6s7eFB
	https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1i4tel9/crash_while_saving_at_random/

	See log file on laptop:
	LeveledList issue maybe - dyfXstQz.txt

	"RomatebitegeL[F] 2 points 22 days ago 

	Yes LeveledItem (53) would be the indicator with the form id associated with it. And I do believe 53 is always at the end.

	It would be great if you could make your analyzer shows as a culprit, in unsure logs, the most showed form id as the probable culprit. This is one thing Skyrim Crash Decoder in fact does well.

	So in this log with OP (that also seems to have been solved) that would have been LeveledItem with form id 0009AF0A.

	Then you can just add the info about deleting it with Resaver. When your analyzer catches this too, then it will become an even more powerful tool!
	"
	Reportedly, this fixed it:
	LeveledList Crash Fix

		- Create a new character/save
		- Advanced Users: might be able to salvage the save file by using ReSaver to delete the mentioned, associated FormID

1. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (unsure where to send?) Fix/update this line:
	- "Please report any issues (or share suggestions) in my r/Nolvus reddit post."
		- shouldn't go to Nolvus post for skyrim users....
		- Probably can't see my posts from my suspended-for-technical-irregularities account anyway....

	- indicator SEQ\ccBGSSSE037-Curios.SEQ

3. Skeleton Issue ... remove from diagnoses and leave only at bottom of speculation. If anything else matches ... favor it





0. Consider making and fully implementing a reusable list item for VRAMr ... like with LOOT. 



0. Critical Memory Usage Detected:
	- mention more info in Memory report near bottom of report
	- consider mentioning RAM upgrade?

1. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Test for Crash Logger: verify version of SKSE (from filename) against version of Skyrim
	- example: "skse64_1_5_97.dll"  pairs with "Skyrim SSE v1.5.97"



- Something like: "The loading and ongoing usage of some character presets can also sometimes cause this issue. If this issue repeats, try creating a new character without loading a preset."
		- Does this only affect 1.5 97? Need to research on Nexus page...


1. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ New test? "SKSEPlugin_Load" --> possibly wrong version of SKSE? Or other possible SKSE-related reasons (see GK note)
	- incorporate patchuli's ideas about SKSE plugins (originally just in "First-Line Issue")
	- display test result near bottom of Advanced Users section (right above DynDOLOD?)
	- warn is a new indicator
	- It's rare (which means false-positives seem less likely👍). From scanning my Crash Log Library:  Search "SKSEPlugin_Load" (20 hits in 7 files of 6372 searched) [Normal]"




1. ⭐️⭐️Research and correct this statement in Upscaler Issue:
	- "the Upscaler mod, which is designed to improve the game's graphics by increasing the resolution of textures"
	- perhaps rewrite as something like this?:  "the Upscaler mod, which is designed to improve the games performance through lower resolution processing, but still keeping the overall fidelity of textures



1. ⭐️⭐️New TEST: flag when Non-ESL-ed plugins:  is less than say .. 50 ... and warn that it could be because not all plugins are showing due to going over the maximum number of Non-ESL-ed plugins (254) or because of a missing masters.
	- Put this test in the "Higher Confidence" portion of "Advanced Users" section.
	- Repeat Missing Masters info as necessary.
	- Repeat Non-ESLed plugins limit info as necessary. 
	- Test log: over 254 limit - undetectable maybe - crash-2025-02-14-15-31-11.log
	- https://discord.com/channels/341090804611285003/341362343273562122/1340020173964574752

1 Mesh Issues:
	- ?UX Fix?: move LOOT out of "Fix Mesh Issues" section....



	- ⏸️(NEXT VERSION) ➡️Modify  owner/target. if (sectionsCount > 1) section so it works with NSF logs
		- ⏸️(NEXT VERSION) ➡️Do NSF logs even have owner/target?

1. Files/Elements (Advanced version under development):
	- ⭐️⭐️Need to make it so multiple FormIDs can show up under one group
		- currently my classic Wolf test doesn't even show the correct FormID to delete
		- already seems to do this for NSF logs?
			- Simplest Horses - Animated Ice Floes - NavMesh-Pathing Issue - Crash_2025_1_16_0-54-34.txt



1. ⏸️PAUSE FOR REDDIT: ⭐️⭐️⭐️Markdown Indentations are too large? For Discord, make sure all <li> indents are TWO (2) spaces per level of indentation (not 3). And also test on Reddit (if possible?) to make sure it's compatible with that too.
	- if varies between Discord and Reddit, put some copy-paste settings right below the Insights section. Keep it compact. Title maybe "Markdown options for single-click copy to clipboard functionality"
	- also, put another checkbox down there for "URLs only, no hyperlinked text in markdown"




⭐️⭐️⭐️CRASH LOG KEYWORD BANK
	- Add new keywords from "CRASH LOG KEYWORD BANK"
	- https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSpp90sjG9ANsxAOkLN9fL17D6rAle8K9aXP2zsnIbqYz8PEYZGVfFVw1l6UnQLo3qa6RCBJD7FzZ-l/pub
	- Source of new tests?


--- Upcoming version ideas ---



1. ⭐️Upgrading Files/Elements:
	- add to Test Logs
		- ⭐️FormIDs and other indented stuff
	- can't depend on "➕" for NSF logs
	- needs more testing
	- ensure compatibility for both Crash Logger and Net Script Framework logs
	- Do NSF logs even have the "Owner:"/"Target:" sections in their log lines?
	- ensure same functionality for both Owner/Target and regular lines
		- consider refactoring for some shared code used by both?
	- Do the different indented keywords besides "FormID" and "Name:" and "File:" work with NSF logs?
	- ⭐️⭐️BUG with this log:
		- https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1hpo9ye/persistent_crash_near_mixwater_mill_cell_deleted/
		- Not displaying the best FormID to delete, which is clearly also associated with the wolf:
			- 0xFF00118A
		- (Also not finding second instance of "Wolf" (or at least not displaying ... but I suppose it shouldn't ... or at least it shouldn't display it, but both FormIDs should be displayed)
		- RBP 0x20C6E487400      (Character*)
			File: "Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp"
			Modified by: Skyrim.esm -> Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp
			Flags: 0x0840042B kDeleted
			Name: "Wolf"
			➡️FormID: 0x00085604
			FormType: ActorCharacter (62)
			Object Reference: 
			Flags: 0x00000008 kInitialized
			Name: "Wolf"
			➡️FormID: 0xFF00118A
			FormType: NPC (43)



2. ⭐️⭐️Revise NavMesh/Pathing test with instructions for using FormIDs from Forms/Elements when the new version of logSummaryAdvanced.JS is loaded. Perhaps include a new const in that file? Something like:  hasFormIdsInFormsAndElements = true; test for var existing, and then if var = true.







--

1. ⭐️Review the 70+ reported bugs with Nolvus v6 and try to extract out any new tests which could be broadly applicable


1. FormID scraper test. List all FormID/name pairs? instances matching `Name: "Silvia" FormID: 0xFF000DC3` and count all occurrences of each FormID
	- https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1imzjtg/crashing_outside_of_darklight_tower/


1. Consider listing conflicting mods as another potential cause of a Missing Masters?
	- https://discord.com/channels/341090804611285003/1338467559149666325/1338551629309415526

1. Consider merging these two tests:
	- ❓ CompressedArchiveStream Issue Detected:
	- ❓ Possible Texture Issue Indicators Found:
	- In this log ... they both repeat a lot?
		- isolated texture - D6DDDA - Lorerim - crash-2025-02-08-22-04-10.log

1. Consider no longer emphasizing Memory issue for D6DDDA? It's kind of a repeat of what it already says above it the D6DDDA issue, but might overly steer users towards memory issues instead of texture issues?


3. XP Skeleton mod issue not listed in analyzer's report (see recent Reddit reply)
   - https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1ihfoxi/need_help_reading_crash_log/
   - "Found out it was a problem with XP32 skeleton extended. I didn't download some of the requirements (Optimized scripts and payprus script fix ) but now everything is working fine."

❌⏸️Could anyone help me see if we can reproduce this potential fix for  DLAA Incompatibility KERNELBASE Crash?
	From Domocles:
	"For DLSS and windows 11 24H2 crash, look like "Nvidia HDR" and/or "Nvidia low latency mode" in the Nvidia app 3D graphic settings have something to do with that. I managed to make  ENB Anti-Aliasing - AMD FSR 3.1 - NVIDIA DLAA works by disabling both"
	https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/1168063977029382235/1337068256564871198





3. ⏸️PAUSE FOR FEEDBACK: New Bad Mods list for presumably abandoned mods that are currently known for causing issues. Usually it would be advised to use an alternative to this/these mod(s):
	- thanks wankingskeever!
	- Climates of Tamriel: https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1igbdfl/game_keeps_crashing_whenever_i_leave_the_helgen/
		- second instance (withing a day or two?): https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1id7gqa/game_crashes_sometimes_when_i_fast_travel/
		- newest version I could find: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31978?tab=description
		- indicator showed up in 34 files in my library: ClimatesOfTamriel.esp


4. ⏸️ New features derived from LOOT?


1. Explain how textures can cause issues?
wankingskeever:
https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/s/lqCVJga1K5
“
D6DDDA

Means one of these:

1.	⁠Running out of system memory. You should increase your page files
2.	⁠Bad texture. Incorrect dimensions, corrupt file
3.	⁠Incorrectly configured texture sets in a mod

“

2. Two or three new ideas shared with me by wankingskeever as replies on r/SkyrimMods

3. Any new tests from this NSF article from 2021?
https://arca.live/b/dagothur/31805310


--- Next version ---



0. New SKSE issues test:
	- instructions like bottom half of VCRUNTIME
	- expand upon scriptIssues in crashInidacatorsMap.js
	- see notepad++ "new45" for a stripped down list of potential files to look for (from explainersMap)
	- https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1idt6bk/skyrim_se_ctd_when_durnehviir_uses_shout_during/
	- see notes on New DbSkseFunctions.dll crash ... which should also be an indicator?
	- These indicators might only be relevant if first-line indicators?
	- What indicators?


2. Mention long covid on my profiles? And make sure all profiles all cross-link:
	- GitHub
	- Ko-fi
	- Patreon
	- Reddit
	- Discord


--- HOLDING OFF FOR 300 to 400 users per day ... and likely only if Ko-fi isn't successful  ---

✅Version 1.x:
https://phostwood.github.io/crash-analyzer/


#The Great Monetization?

1  Banner ads directly after that!  :-)
   - Banner free for Nolvus Discord Helpers should be doable!
      - https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/gq3e6pKpmhc2DsB5X3d81
	  - still need to figure out a way for Roma and MaskPlague and Krispyroll though ... maybe make my own Discord for the analyzer and make user rolls for them once they sign in?
   - Need to find the best, high-paying, but never unethical banner ad service. No popups. No fake user interfaces. Either targeted ads or like video game or generic ads. Nothing not safe for work. Must be truly mobile friendly. Small banners at top and bottom if mobile. If good screen resolution then feel free to put larger vertical ads on the side. Needs to be easy to use in JS/HTML web aps hosted on GitHub Pages. American or European Union based. Must be a big, ethical-ish company (or at least one that everyone is forced to use anyway).
2. Code to disable banners for Nolvus Discord Helpers
3. Create my own Phostwood Crash Log Analyzer Discord, with a group called Helpers. And offer to add Roma, and Krispyroll, and Mask
4. Paypal and KoFi buttons
5. Patreon subscribers get no ads (currently none of these, so a lower priority)
6. KoFi subscribers get no ads to, if possible?





--- NOTES on SHELVED nested 🔎Files/Elements with FormIDs: ---

1. (potentially) Files/Elements list now includes safer-to-remove FormIDs
	- ✅FIXED?❗ISSUE: misses some of the named elements ... this is the biggest issue❗
		- ✅FIXED?the old version didn't miss any...
		- ✅FIXED?the new version misses some that are caught by the old version and by Texture/Mesh Issues
		- ❓I do see more of the x -> y -> z stuff in the old version, but I'm not sure I care? Has that ever been useful?
	- ✅FIXED? ISSUE: adds ` after some of the matches with FormIDs?
	- ✅FIXED? ISSUE: duplicates some of the lines?
	- ISSUE: truncates some really long lines in wrong direction (but do this afterwards ... maybe even next version)
2. (pending step 1 above) Add instructions to Pathing issue for deleting FormIDs
	- see long notes below (search for FormIDs) and in GK notes
	- Perhaps word the item under Pathing/Navmesh Issue something like this:

"As a hack, with at least some theoretical risk, consider using ReSaver [show download and instruction links too] to delete FormIDs found in the 🔎 Files/Elements section of this report. NOTE: those beginning with '0xFF" should be safer to delete, because they are generic and randomly spawned specific to that save." 

"Form IDs that start with 0xFF are generated dynamically at run time which means that the NPC is generic and that Form ID is specific to that save." - MaskPlague

<li>Consider using save cleaning tools to remove orphaned scripts and other potential corruption. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76776">FallrimTools ReSaver</a> can sometimes fix corrupted save files. See also these <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/s/fbMRv343vm">instructions by Krispyroll</a> and more information in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1d0r0f0/reading_crash_logs/##:~:text=Resaver">Krispyroll's Reading Crash Logs Guide</a>. NOTE: Always keep backups of your saves before attempting fixes or using cleaning tools.</li>



--- Future 1.x Version ---

6. Catch up on on TestLogs (from at least one if not from a couple prior versions?)
	- ✅Baseform: null (?) for NSF Test Log
	- 

2. Review Crash Log Library and try to classify everything

--- next version ---

- Line truncating fix:  when truncating a line with <-- it makes sense to truncate at the end (current behavior), but for --> arrows, it should truncate keep the last 1,000 characters ... not the first 1,000

- POSSIBLE BUG where sections.topHalf doesn't include "stack" for NSF logs?

➡️4. Consider loosening up regexes in extractNifPathsToListItems and TEXTURE and ANIMATION versions to allow other word delimiters via looser regex

	- NEEDS THOROUGH TESTING

	- Speed Optimization? Consider making a new log sections called allFilesInTopHalf and allFilesInBottomHalf. And from there, when I want a file, just search it? However, the list wouldn't contain any information about what section it was found in....


--- for future versions ---

3. New sections. variables for:
	- sections.RamTotal		    (CLSSE or Trainwreck?)
	- sections.RamUsed			(CLSSE or Trainwreck?)
	- sections.VramTotal		(CLSSE only?)
	- sections.VramUsed			(CLSSE only?)
	- sections.PagefileTotal	(Trainwreck only?)
	- sections.PagefileUsed		(Trainwreck only?)
	- CPU check (towards telling about the microcode update for Intel)


	- NOTE: decided to put these into Sections. variables instead of Utils.? I think I could then pass just Sections.Head to the above extractions, which would make them faster and possibly more accurate...
	- Create new high priority Memory Issues section for Diagnoses section of report (see GK note)
	- Consider making the existing Memory Issues troubleshooting steps de-emphasize RAM and stuff if there is plenty of it in there?



3. New "Low on Memory" test
    - as a new indicator for memory issues
	- new line in log summary
	- report back to Krispyroll when done, and for his review of its troubleshooting text




1. Review overlaps between Animations and Animation Loader tests. Consider reducing the overlap.

2. Consider adding System Management section (from D6DDDA issue or other?) to the "No highest0-confidence indictors found" suggestions? OR just leave that to a upcoming memory issues test?

1. New test to recommend deleting FormIDs with ReSaver:

	- "Form IDs that start with 0xFF are generated dynamically at run time which means that the NPC is generic and that Form ID is specific to that save." - MaskPlague
	
	- Possible mod idea? https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136456
		- Doesn't allow editing, but to a technical-ish person it would probably help find a navmesh issue and isolate the mod responsible for it

	- Criticism about adding it:  https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/1168063977029382235/1326898286115688518

1. Trim down and tone down Jerilith's rules

2. Removed “unlikely cause” when named elements are included in the list (already removed when files are in the list)

5. KERNELBASE functions with short and long versions.
	- Long version needs to have Nolvus-only instructions injected into main instructions
	- consider isolating "Apply Order" and "Reinstall Nolvus" instructions into reusable code to be shared across multiple tests
	- make sure all instructions are reconciled between Nolvus and non-Nolvus versions

6. KERNELBASE JSON Crash Detected: does the guide need to include the other configuration recommended by Roma?

7. De-Nolvus-ify ENB issue? Unless there are already two versions? And turn it into a function so it isn't so confusing to maintain. Also separate reusable code for reinstalling Nolvus (or not if I'm just linking to google doc?).



--- COMING SOON! ---





---
➡️ = unable to test before going live?
⬇️ = downgraded and added to TODO List
✅ = tested and done (may have multiple levels of checkmarks depending on complexity of overall version)
---


?. Add to "no issues found":
	- text version of Safe Save Rules (with a reference link?)
	- set Windows Pagefile
	- SSD free space
	- Verify some frequently-incorrect settings ... use BGSSaveLoadManager stuff for much of this
	- Some crash logs provide more meaningful indicators than others. Try seeing if the crash repeats with the same diagnoses here, and in the Advanced Users section. 





NEXT VERSION: WORKING ON:???

	- make some tests adjust location in report, based on its isHighPriority flag. Texture/Mesh/Animation issues should be listed higher in the report if possibly relevant files were found, and lower if not found.
		- Maybe get rid of the "Memory and Image-related Issues:" section? If isHighPriority then put into "Higher-Confidence Test Results:" section, otherwise, put into "Miscellaneous Issues:" or perhaps a new "Less Likely Issues:" section?

	- If Mesh and/or Texture (and Animation?) sections are also present (and with supporting files listed), then provide links to those related test sections as often being possible/probable causes of memory issues

    - Add instructions somewhere for finding specific mods/files? Something like: "You can search for mentioned files in MO2 or in your Windows File Manager. Once isolated to a specific mod you can try disabling the mod for a quick test. Or for Mesh and Texture Issue sections of the report: In some cases simply re-downloading and reinstalling the mod with a bad mesh or texture, may fix the corrupted file and resolve the issue."

	- uniformly across appropriate test results, mention NifScan, SSE NIF Optimizer, and CAO for fixing meshes textures
	- 🎯 (target emoji) doesn't seem to show up right on PC Chrome ... maybe remove them with the click-to-copy function?
		- However, this one (pasted into Notepad, and then into Reddit markup) works just fine?

	- Navmesh/path test(s)? Do they troubleshoot the same?

CombatMusicFix_NG.dll. version check
Bad version 1
Fixed version 1.1
CombatMusicFix_NG.dll crashes.
Replace it with this working version instead:
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110459?tab=files
What version  is the replacement (1.1) show up as?

Source:
https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/s/YuWn9nc57t


1. ??? Remove STEAM from Overlay checks ... it just comes up too much

2. Does "List of mentioned meshes" reflect named and filename meshes from all mesh indicators? It probably should?
	- same for Utils.extractHkxPathsToListItems() ... it should also check all Animation Indicators
	- same for Utils.extractSkyrimTexturePathsToListItems ??


IN PROGRESS: 
Final steps:
- Update version number
- Review DIFFs for all changed files
- Final round of standard new version tests
- PUSH! Enough features for one version!

- Remove mentions of Nolvus from Skyrim.html version


Next:

See Google Keep notes on:
- new Animations test
- Add test for po3_PapyrusExtender version in CL/TW
	- add new function to get version number of a mod (where available)
	- refactor ConsoleUtilSSE version check code with the new function as well
- Adjust shadow description

- merge animation tests (old one into new one, with hexcode in the map)?

- for D6DDDA  test, it mentions broken meshes as a possible cause, but it doesn't list the new troubleshooting steps. Perhaps instead of rehashing them, tell them to look for the Mesh Issue description in the Advance User section for details.
	- mentioned twice? in normal and Advanced User sections?


- feasible to rewrite Named Elements section (again) to show ownership of named elements by specific files (where indicated by the log)?
	- could also same feature to list of meshes and textures reported on in various tests

- Update version number
- PUSH! Enough features for one version!

---


NEXT Version: Utils.extractNifPathsToListItems() might need to be updated with name1Regex and name2Regex values that are compatible with the syntaxes in CrashLogger or Trainwreck logs?

NEXT VERSION: For Skyrim.html, upgrade the Advanced User's High-Confidence insights into the upper, Diagnoses section of the page
	- Will probably need to wrap them in functions
	- Also, perhaps move them to a different JS file? Maybe diagnoses.js?
	- or maybe wait to do this with the big diagnoses refactoring with test data being extrapolated into data objects?
		- or maybe some tests can't be extrapolated into data objects ... making them into functions in diagnoses.js might be a good place to start at least?

NEXT VERSION: Named Elements section has some differences between NSF and CrashLogger logs. Make them match up, or at least map out why each difference exists.

NEXT VERSION: Alphabetized Load Order Test: Standard, vanilla Nolvus is almost 64% alphabetized by this metric ... perhaps it should include ESM and ESL files to decrease that number and make it a more universally useful metric across other modlists? Theoretically, I think I'd rather have the threshold set from current 70% down to like 50%?

- ✅ Shorten LOOT section in Missing Masters test

✅~✅ NEXT Version: GraveLord issue isn't showing up in Trainwreck Test Log? Check number of diagnoses from al three log types and make them all match up with the same test results.

✅ Merge mesh issues into one (or two) tests. See in code temporary notes in comment under "General Mesh Issues" List the nifscan tool as mentioned in r/Skyrim's wiki, and already used in hair test. Also, mention "nif optimizer"
	- Most common cause is a faulty mesh that appears in that location. Confirm that all meshes are good by running them through nifscan, which may also isolate a bad mesh to a specific mod. If any are not ported you probably can fix them with "nif optimizer" or CAO
	- Can also search log for found names/filenames for meshes and try to isolate them to a specific mod. If found, you can then try disabling that mod to see if it fixes your issue.

BUGS?


- PAUSE: Why does this say Customized, but doesn't list any non-nolvus mods?
	-	BetterThirdPersonSelection - Crash_2024_4_24_13-16-36.txt
	- I'm guess they removed some vanilla mods?
	- LIKELY: Or, since they have zero extras installed, maybe my test is off?
	- rewrite BGSSaveLoadManager description to be useful, include save cleaning tool link, and don't recommend doing command kill and then potentially continuing on from a save (which could  make it worse)
	- On analyzeLog.js:   "// Check for Nolvus or Nolvus-like modlist" section, either expand the list of mods to test for, or don't make it sound so much like it's mostly Nolvus mods. (Should either be made more complex, or simplified)

- NEXT VERSION (Unused anyway): sections.Plugins isn't grabbing the right data from an applicable NSF log. In this example, it should grab just "2", but is instead grabbing "Plugin_Name: Version 1.0\nPlugin_Name: Version 1.0" ... which curiously, doesn't seem to exist in the log?

- REFACTOR: composite sections so they are just section numbers mapping to sectionMap, and make a special function to loop through the specified section numbers to search through sections of sectionsMap, and return the match along with the section number it was found in.

- REFACTOR: remove section content from sections? Only use sectionsMap?

- REFACTOR: move all log flags/identifiers into either sections or sectionsMap?
	- sections.isSkyrimPage
	- sections.hasSkyrimAE
	- sections.isNolvus
	- sections.logType
	- others?

1. SKIP or PAUSE: Skyrim Crash Analyzer probably shouldn't show any diagnoses ... just advanced user stuff?

1.2 If named elements are from the same line of a crash log, then somehow the list should reflect that. Maybe indentation? Or mabye "firstItem --> secondItem --> thirdItem"?
	- Maybe collect the lines into an array of arrays? With line number in the first array, and then numbered matches as the second array?
		- However, I think that would necessitate parsing each line differently. Currently, I'm scraping file extensions from a line, and then scraping File: and Name: from the same line ... loosing their relative order (if within the same line)


2. "You can only have one Crash Logger active at a time including NetScriptFramework (disable crash dumps in the config). If you're using NetScriptFramework, it's probably the better logger still unless you need PDB support."
	- source: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818
	- Test for which version of Skyrim is being used, looking for either of these lines:
		- Crash Logger Line 1 (0):  Skyrim SSE v1.5.97
		- NSF Line 8 (7): ApplicationName: SkyrimSE.exe
		- If not AE, then recommend NSF instead of Crash Logger
		- If AE, then recommend Crash Logger instead of NSF
	- Improve the hasSkyrimAE flag to be more accurate with check described above
	- If possible, test for multiple crash logger mods, and list them, and recommend disabling all but hte right one


- - - PAUSE - - -
1. New version of Potentially Misorganized Nolvus Plugins test:
	- A. a version worded for non-Nolvus users for ideas on how to organize their plugins
	- B. Show how far each plugin is out of order relative to what other vanilla plugins, and which vanilla plugins it expects to be above/below it
		- indicate like:  mod name.esp (out of order by 3, typically located below X and above Y)
	- C. Show what plugins it expects to be above/below it (to help manually fix the order)
	- maybe indicate extra info through "i" emoji that user can hover over?

0. New issue interface for refactored tests:
	- Hovering over the "i" emoji(s) should show additional information:
		- what indicators the test is looking for
	- Separate descriptions for both Nolvus and non-Nolvus users
	- 

1.1. Kernelbase JSON Crash change:
	- Apparently the go-to fix for this on Nolvus is to edit EngineFixes.toml ... so put #3 as a new #1 so it's the first thing users try.
	- post graphic to r/Nolvus
	- link to graphic from the analyzer
	- related: https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/755346172243214376/1260031303064223884



2. If overlay warning or virus warning is the only thing, then still show no diagnosis found. Perhaps show it if diagnosis count = 0?
4. Add the word "sequence" into Apply Order descriptions and any mention of load order for clarity? 

5. New Skyrim AE Test: ConsoleUtilSSE.dll in Probable call stack --> ConsoleUtilSSE.dll v1.4 is not compatible. Download v1.5.1 instead here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76649?tab=files
