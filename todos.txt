‚úÖVersion 1.22.10 is now live:
https://phostwood.github.io/crash-analyzer/


Mostly fixes and minor enhancements for prior, just-released version:

1. "üéØ Likely Journal Crash Detected:" AND  "‚ùì Potential Journal Crash Detected:"
	- Improved consistency between related troubleshooting instructions
	- Improved reliability of spotting indicators (case-insensitive comparisons)
	- Separated (and clarified to user) area of crash logs checked by each test:
		- "Detected indicators in top third of crash log:"
		- "Detected indicators in Stack portion of crash log:"
	- Added crashIndicators.questJournalIssues usage to "‚ùì" variant of test

2. explainersMap.js:
	- ['engine_fixes.dll', '(SSE Engine Fixes <b>SKSE</b> plugin ... less likely culprit)'],
		- but discovered version without the underscore character, so added:
        	- ['enginefixes.dll', '(SSE Engine Fixes <b>SKSE</b> plugin ... less likely culprit)'],
	- ['tbbmalloc.dll', '(Intel Threading Building Blocks Memory Allocator - likely from <b>SSE Engine Fixes</b> - Part 2  ... less likely culprit)'],
		- added "... less likely culprit"

3. crashInidacatorsMap.js:
	- added "JournalMenu" indicator from "‚ùì Potential Journal Crash Detected:" to now-shared crashIndicators.questJournalIssues

4. Slight rewording/clarification to "Redundant BEES":
	- "Some have reported that this redundancy can potentially contribute towards crashes."

0. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èGet back to Blackread on his stuff on Occlusions and Missing Masters

0. Check out these social medias for Modded Skyrim stuff?
	- Digg is where everyone used to be before they made some bad choices and people went to Reddit.  But they've redesigned and are trying to woo people back.
	- Lenny is an open source Reddit

1. New test for when no GPU-specific drivers are installed
	- https://discord.com/channels/341090804611285003/341362343273562122/1349149865636139143
	- crash-2025-03-11-11-40-39.log
	- Manufucturer drivers should provide better performance, and possibly offer better stability


1. Review log files and resolutions/determinations in Biggie's lorerim-reports channel


2. New test for Likely Physics issue:
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1j18pa7/comment/mg2ka3d/
	- new high-priority indicator:  "HDT Skinned Mesh Physics Ob ject"
	- my library only has 20 files which include this indicator
		- Need to review each of them, but it looks sufficiently rare to be a likely-reliable indicator

0. Consider adding to Recommended Tools:
	- Asset Doctor: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123445

1. Move some old r/Nolvus docs from u/Phostwood into Google Docs for safer storage and sharing

0. Links to consider changing:
	- Link from "graduated from beta" to Discord?
	- Link from modding Nolvus guide from reddit to Customized Nolvus Catalog?
	- other?

2. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èSetup a tentative new largely-unused u/PhostwoodReturns user, and make him an emergency moderator on r/Phostwood ... just in case that "technical irregularities" bot on Reddit goes crazy again and suspends u/PhostwoodReborn. (Crazy that I even feel the need to do this. Too much these days is being automated, seemingly without any timely human-adjudicated recourse.)


1. Make a note to NavMesh/Pathing issues that 
	- Thanks Blackread!
	- ME: "I've heard the NPC doesn't even have to be in your same area to be the cause of a NavMesh issue? Some mods apparently will move some NPCs around in different corners of the Skyrim map regardless of where you are at the time? I've never done it, but searching the entirety of Skyrim for navmesh issues sounds like a daunting task?"
	- Blackread: "Yeah, the other navmesh crash was happening fast traveling from Winterhold to Solitude when the actual problem was in Rorikstead. Probably it can even be some newlands mod."
	- others have said this too, but I can't recall who for sure
	- 




2. ‚ùó <b>Possible Visual C++ Runtime DLL Issue
	- update with patchuli's same new info on dll troubleshooting as used in ‚ùóCritical First-Line Error Detected

1. An system to alert user after they click or engage "Analyze" to alert them that a new version is available. Please either refresh the page if using live, or download the most recent version if using the stand-alone Nexus mod". Maybe in a colored area below the "Analyze" button?


1. Add Pan's screenshot (see mention in v6 bug 10(?))
	2. 1. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èNew skee first-line error test
	https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/1323816364007227504/1340187701701378151
		Also: ‚ùì skee64.dll Issue Detected:
			- make it include the statement about skeleton meshes not being as good indicators
			- its files list needs to be changed over to the new shared-code way
			- if the item is removable, remove it in-game before disabling the crashing mod
				- https://discord.com/channels/215154001799413770/701100960134725713/1341090629895323740
			- Common issue: "Overlays" are usually the wearable tattoos or piercings or such
		- ‚û°Ô∏èCHANGED PLAN:
			- Do a separate Nolvus version with Pan's instructions
			- Do a Skyrim version saying to change filename to `.backup` or `.disabled` at the end (temporarily)





1. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èskyrimcrashdecoder did this one better: DwemerBeardLowerBraidsA - Skyrim crash log (19).txt
	- Probably a FaceGen issue. Could be missing or corrupt FaceGen data or some other NPC face related problem. Possibly related to: Name: "DwemerBeardLowerBraidsA"
	Crash was likely caused by one of the following mods: Skyrim.esm -> Update.esm -> Dragonborn.esm -> unofficial skyrim special edition patch.esp -> LegacyoftheDragonborn.esm -> CollegeOfWinterholdImmersive.esp -> Immersive Encounters.esp
	Probably one of them accessing or clashing with this mod: "immersive encounters.esp".
	The following record might have been involved in the crash: name: "rzalth" formid: 0x00000007.
	To fix the issue, you can try disabling one or more of the mods mentioned above. If the crash still happens, try again with a new log. If you are an advanced Skyrim modder, you can use a tool like SSEEdit to see more information about what record the FormID contains and which mods are accessing it.

1. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èGood phrase from skyrimcrashdecoder:
	- "If you are an advanced Skyrim modder, you can use a tool like SSEEdit to see more information about what record the FormID contains and which mods are accessing it."
	- add to it something like: and/or use ReSaver to remove the problematic FormID from your save (although, some may respawn, and others can cause problems when removed)

1. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èskyrimcrashdecoder offers some extra insight into this log:
	- "Probably an issue with an Object Reference (this could be an item or an NPC placed or modified by a mod)."
	- "Crash was likely caused by one of the following mods: Skyrim.esm -> unofficial skyrim special edition patch.esp"
	- "Probably one of them accessing or clashing with this mod: "thenewgentleman.esp"."
	- Crashlog (arjvSyyR).txt




‚û°Ô∏èüîéForms/Elements BUGS: ‚¨ÖÔ∏è
0. Bug where mesh name (file isn't listed by name is) isn't listed in experimental File/Elements (but is in normal version's)

1. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èFile/Elements bug where skeleton for beast shows up in nifs issue list, but not in Files/Elements?
	- crash-2025-02-28-05-01-12.log
2. Files/Elements (Advanced version under development):
	- ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èNeed to make it so multiple FormIDs can show up under one group
		- currently my classic Wolf test doesn't even show the correct FormID to delete
		- already seems to do this for NSF logs?
			- Simplest Horses - Animated Ice Floes - NavMesh-Pathing Issue - Crash_2025_1_16_0-54-34.txt
3. Wrong FormID's attached to object?
	- Crash_2025_2_20_23-12-43.txt
	- v6 Bug 65
	- The hourglass is listing a lot of FormIDs, at lest one of which (the "FF...") doesn't seem to belong to it:
		- - `[2] Hourglass`
			- `[2] FormID: 2C0BA82F`
			- `[2] FormID: 2C0BA7B5`
			- `[2] FormID: 2C0BA7C5`

	- My FaceGen test should have showed up here, and listed that beard. Also, that beard should probably have been listed under mesh files. while the "Possible Mesh Issue" was flagged
		- referencing: https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1j26jc8/need_help_game_crashes_when_swinging_weapon_or/
0. Mod(s) with sufficient prominence in crash log get highlighted with a "‚≠êÔ∏è" or "‚û°Ô∏è" emoji?
	- or maybe add prominence indicators to the end of each line in Files/Elements?
		- Perhaps a checkbox at the top of Files/Elements to add these?
0. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èFile/Elements bug where skeleton for beast shows up in nifs issue list, but not in Files/Elements?

‚û°Ô∏è END: üîéForms/Elements BUGS ‚¨ÖÔ∏è



2. ‚è∏Ô∏è‚≠êÔ∏èNew test: levelList crash (see notes)

	https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/s/vbsk6s7eFB
	https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1i4tel9/crash_while_saving_at_random/

	See log file on laptop:
	LeveledList issue maybe - dyfXstQz.txt

	"RomatebitegeL[F] 2 points 22 days ago 

	Yes LeveledItem (53) would be the indicator with the form id associated with it. And I do believe 53 is always at the end.

	It would be great if you could make your analyzer shows as a culprit, in unsure logs, the most showed form id as the probable culprit. This is one thing Skyrim Crash Decoder in fact does well.

	So in this log with OP (that also seems to have been solved) that would have been LeveledItem with form id 0009AF0A.

	Then you can just add the info about deleting it with Resaver. When your analyzer catches this too, then it will become an even more powerful tool!
	"
	Reportedly, this fixed it:

1. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è (unsure where to send?) Fix/update this line:
	- "Please report any issues (or share suggestions) in my r/Nolvus reddit post."
		- shouldn't go to Nolvus post for skyrim users....
		- Probably can't see my posts from my suspended-for-technical-irregularities account anyway....

3. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èConsider softening "12F4797 Physics Crash"

	- indicator SEQ\ccBGSSSE037-Curios.SEQ

3. Skeleton Issue ... remove from diagnoses and leave only at bottom of speculation. If anything else matches ... favor it





0. Consider making and fully implementing a reusable list item for VRAMr ... like with LOOT. 



0. Critical Memory Usage Detected:
	- mention more info in Memory report near bottom of report
	- consider mentioning RAM upgrade?

1. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Test for Crash Logger: verify version of SKSE (from filename) against version of Skyrim
	- example: "skse64_1_5_97.dll"  pairs with "Skyrim SSE v1.5.97"



- Something like: "The loading and ongoing usage of some character presets can also sometimes cause this issue. If this issue repeats, try creating a new character without loading a preset."
		- Does this only affect 1.5 97? Need to research on Nexus page...


1. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è New test? "SKSEPlugin_Load" --> possibly wrong version of SKSE? Or other possible SKSE-related reasons (see GK note)
	- incorporate patchuli's ideas about SKSE plugins (originally just in "First-Line Issue")
	- display test result near bottom of Advanced Users section (right above DynDOLOD?)
	- warn is a new indicator
	- It's rare (which means false-positives seem less likelyüëç). From scanning my Crash Log Library:  Search "SKSEPlugin_Load" (20 hits in 7 files of 6372 searched) [Normal]"




1. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èResearch and correct this statement in Upscaler Issue:
	- "the Upscaler mod, which is designed to improve the game's graphics by increasing the resolution of textures"
	- perhaps rewrite as something like this?:  "the Upscaler mod, which is designed to improve the games performance through lower resolution processing, but still keeping the overall fidelity of textures



1. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èNew TEST: flag when Non-ESL-ed plugins:  is less than say .. 50 ... and warn that it could be because not all plugins are showing due to going over the maximum number of Non-ESL-ed plugins (254) or because of a missing masters.
	- Put this test in the "Higher Confidence" portion of "Advanced Users" section.
	- Repeat Missing Masters info as necessary.
	- Repeat Non-ESLed plugins limit info as necessary. 
	- Test log: over 254 limit - undetectable maybe - crash-2025-02-14-15-31-11.log

1 Mesh Issues:
	- ?UX Fix?: move LOOT out of "Fix Mesh Issues" section....



	- ‚è∏Ô∏è(NEXT VERSION) ‚û°Ô∏èModify  owner/target. if (sectionsCount > 1) section so it works with NSF logs
		- ‚è∏Ô∏è(NEXT VERSION) ‚û°Ô∏èDo NSF logs even have owner/target?

1. Files/Elements (Advanced version under development):
	- ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èNeed to make it so multiple FormIDs can show up under one group
		- currently my classic Wolf test doesn't even show the correct FormID to delete
		- already seems to do this for NSF logs?
			- Simplest Horses - Animated Ice Floes - NavMesh-Pathing Issue - Crash_2025_1_16_0-54-34.txt



1. ‚è∏Ô∏èPAUSE FOR REDDIT: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èMarkdown Indentations are too large? For Discord, make sure all <li> indents are TWO (2) spaces per level of indentation (not 3). And also test on Reddit (if possible?) to make sure it's compatible with that too.
	- if varies between Discord and Reddit, put some copy-paste settings right below the Insights section. Keep it compact. Title maybe "Markdown options for single-click copy to clipboard functionality"
	- also, put another checkbox down there for "URLs only, no hyperlinked text in markdown"




‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èCRASH LOG KEYWORD BANK
	- Add new keywords from "CRASH LOG KEYWORD BANK"
	- https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSpp90sjG9ANsxAOkLN9fL17D6rAle8K9aXP2zsnIbqYz8PEYZGVfFVw1l6UnQLo3qa6RCBJD7FzZ-l/pub
	- Source of new tests?


--- Upcoming version ideas ---



1. ‚≠êÔ∏èUpgrading Files/Elements:
	- add to Test Logs
		- ‚≠êÔ∏èFormIDs and other indented stuff
	- can't depend on "‚ûï" for NSF logs
	- needs more testing
	- ensure compatibility for both Crash Logger and Net Script Framework logs
	- Do NSF logs even have the "Owner:"/"Target:" sections in their log lines?
	- ensure same functionality for both Owner/Target and regular lines
		- consider refactoring for some shared code used by both?
	- Do the different indented keywords besides "FormID" and "Name:" and "File:" work with NSF logs?
	- ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èBUG with this log:
		- https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1hpo9ye/persistent_crash_near_mixwater_mill_cell_deleted/
		- Not displaying the best FormID to delete, which is clearly also associated with the wolf:
			- 0xFF00118A
		- (Also not finding second instance of "Wolf" (or at least not displaying ... but I suppose it shouldn't ... or at least it shouldn't display it, but both FormIDs should be displayed)
		- RBP 0x20C6E487400      (Character*)
			File: "Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp"
			Modified by: Skyrim.esm -> Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp
			Flags: 0x0840042B kDeleted
			Name: "Wolf"
			‚û°Ô∏èFormID: 0x00085604
			FormType: ActorCharacter (62)
			Object Reference: 
			Flags: 0x00000008 kInitialized
			Name: "Wolf"
			‚û°Ô∏èFormID: 0xFF00118A
			FormType: NPC (43)



2. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èRevise NavMesh/Pathing test with instructions for using FormIDs from Forms/Elements when the new version of logSummaryAdvanced.JS is loaded. Perhaps include a new const in that file? Something like:  hasFormIdsInFormsAndElements = true; test for var existing, and then if var = true.







--

1. ‚≠êÔ∏èReview the 70+ reported bugs with Nolvus v6 and try to extract out any new tests which could be broadly applicable


1. FormID scraper test. List all FormID/name pairs? instances matching `Name: "Silvia" FormID: 0xFF000DC3` and count all occurrences of each FormID
	- https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1imzjtg/crashing_outside_of_darklight_tower/


1. Consider listing conflicting mods as another potential cause of a Missing Masters?
	- https://discord.com/channels/341090804611285003/1338467559149666325/1338551629309415526

1. Consider merging these two tests:
	- ‚ùì CompressedArchiveStream Issue Detected:
	- ‚ùì Possible Texture Issue Indicators Found:
	- In this log ... they both repeat a lot?
		- isolated texture - D6DDDA - Lorerim - crash-2025-02-08-22-04-10.log

1. Consider no longer emphasizing Memory issue for D6DDDA? It's kind of a repeat of what it already says above it the D6DDDA issue, but might overly steer users towards memory issues instead of texture issues?


3. XP Skeleton mod issue not listed in analyzer's report (see recent Reddit reply)
   - https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1ihfoxi/need_help_reading_crash_log/
   - "Found out it was a problem with XP32 skeleton extended. I didn't download some of the requirements (Optimized scripts and payprus script fix ) but now everything is working fine."

‚ùå‚è∏Ô∏èCould anyone help me see if we can reproduce this potential fix for  DLAA Incompatibility KERNELBASE Crash?
	From Domocles:
	"For DLSS and windows 11 24H2 crash, look like "Nvidia HDR" and/or "Nvidia low latency mode" in the Nvidia app 3D graphic settings have something to do with that. I managed to make  ENB Anti-Aliasing - AMD FSR 3.1 - NVIDIA DLAA works by disabling both"

3. ‚è∏Ô∏èPAUSE FOR FEEDBACK: New Bad Mods list for presumably abandoned mods that are currently known for causing issues. Usually it would be advised to use an alternative to this/these mod(s):
	- thanks wankingskeever!
	- Climates of Tamriel: https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1igbdfl/game_keeps_crashing_whenever_i_leave_the_helgen/
		- second instance (withing a day or two?): https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1id7gqa/game_crashes_sometimes_when_i_fast_travel/
		- newest version I could find: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31978?tab=description
		- indicator showed up in 34 files in my library: ClimatesOfTamriel.esp


4. ‚è∏Ô∏è New features derived from LOOT?


1. Explain how textures can cause issues?
wankingskeever:
https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/s/lqCVJga1K5
‚Äú
D6DDDA

Means one of these:

1.	‚Å†Running out of system memory. You should increase your page files
2.	‚Å†Bad texture. Incorrect dimensions, corrupt file
3.	‚Å†Incorrectly configured texture sets in a mod

‚Äú

2. Two or three new ideas shared with me by wankingskeever as replies on r/SkyrimMods

3. Any new tests from this NSF article from 2021?
https://arca.live/b/dagothur/31805310


--- Next version ---



0. New SKSE issues test:
	- instructions like bottom half of VCRUNTIME
	- expand upon scriptIssues in crashInidacatorsMap.js
	- see notepad++ "new45" for a stripped down list of potential files to look for (from explainersMap)
	- https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1idt6bk/skyrim_se_ctd_when_durnehviir_uses_shout_during/
	- see notes on New DbSkseFunctions.dll crash ... which should also be an indicator?
	- These indicators might only be relevant if first-line indicators?
	- What indicators?


2. Mention long covid on my profiles? And make sure all profiles all cross-link:
	- GitHub
	- Ko-fi
	- Patreon
	- Reddit
	- Discord

	  - still need to figure out a way for Roma and MaskPlague and Krispyroll though ... maybe make my own Discord for the analyzer and make user rolls for them once they sign in?
   - Need to find the best, high-paying, but never unethical banner ad service. No popups. No fake user interfaces. Either targeted ads or like video game or generic ads. Nothing not safe for work. Must be truly mobile friendly. Small banners at top and bottom if mobile. If good screen resolution then feel free to put larger vertical ads on the side. Needs to be easy to use in JS/HTML web aps hosted on GitHub Pages. American or European Union based. Must be a big, ethical-ish company (or at least one that everyone is forced to use anyway).
2. Code to disable banners for Nolvus Discord Helpers
3. Create my own Phostwood Crash Log Analyzer Discord, with a group called Helpers. And offer to add Roma, and Krispyroll, and Mask
4. Paypal and KoFi buttons
5. Patreon subscribers get no ads (currently none of these, so a lower priority)
6. KoFi subscribers get no ads to, if possible?





--- NOTES on SHELVED nested üîéFiles/Elements with FormIDs: ---

1. (potentially) Files/Elements list now includes safer-to-remove FormIDs
	- ‚úÖFIXED?‚ùóISSUE: misses some of the named elements ... this is the biggest issue‚ùó
		- ‚úÖFIXED?the old version didn't miss any...
		- ‚úÖFIXED?the new version misses some that are caught by the old version and by Texture/Mesh Issues
		- ‚ùìI do see more of the x -> y -> z stuff in the old version, but I'm not sure I care? Has that ever been useful?
	- ‚úÖFIXED? ISSUE: adds ` after some of the matches with FormIDs?
	- ‚úÖFIXED? ISSUE: duplicates some of the lines?
	- ISSUE: truncates some really long lines in wrong direction (but do this afterwards ... maybe even next version)
2. (pending step 1 above) Add instructions to Pathing issue for deleting FormIDs
	- see long notes below (search for FormIDs) and in GK notes
	- Perhaps word the item under Pathing/Navmesh Issue something like this:

"As a hack, with at least some theoretical risk, consider using ReSaver [show download and instruction links too] to delete FormIDs found in the üîé Files/Elements section of this report. NOTE: those beginning with '0xFF" should be safer to delete, because they are generic and randomly spawned specific to that save." 

"Form IDs that start with 0xFF are generated dynamically at run time which means that the NPC is generic and that Form ID is specific to that save." - MaskPlague

<li>Consider using save cleaning tools to remove orphaned scripts and other potential corruption. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76776">FallrimTools ReSaver</a> can sometimes fix corrupted save files. See also these <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/s/fbMRv343vm">instructions by Krispyroll</a> and more information in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1d0r0f0/reading_crash_logs/##:~:text=Resaver">Krispyroll's Reading Crash Logs Guide</a>. NOTE: Always keep backups of your saves before attempting fixes or using cleaning tools.</li>



--- Future 1.x Version ---

6. Catch up on on TestLogs (from at least one if not from a couple prior versions?)
	- ‚úÖBaseform: null (?) for NSF Test Log
	- 

2. Review Crash Log Library and try to classify everything

--- next version ---

- Line truncating fix:  when truncating a line with <-- it makes sense to truncate at the end (current behavior), but for --> arrows, it should truncate keep the last 1,000 characters ... not the first 1,000

- POSSIBLE BUG where sections.topHalf doesn't include "stack" for NSF logs?

‚û°Ô∏è4. Consider loosening up regexes in extractNifPathsToListItems and TEXTURE and ANIMATION versions to allow other word delimiters via looser regex

	- NEEDS THOROUGH TESTING

	- Speed Optimization? Consider making a new log sections called allFilesInTopHalf and allFilesInBottomHalf. And from there, when I want a file, just search it? However, the list wouldn't contain any information about what section it was found in....


--- for future versions ---

3. New sections. variables for:
	- sections.RamTotal		    (CLSSE or Trainwreck?)
	- sections.RamUsed			(CLSSE or Trainwreck?)
	- sections.VramTotal		(CLSSE only?)
	- sections.VramUsed			(CLSSE only?)
	- sections.PagefileTotal	(Trainwreck only?)
	- sections.PagefileUsed		(Trainwreck only?)
	- CPU check (towards telling about the microcode update for Intel)


	- NOTE: decided to put these into Sections. variables instead of Utils.? I think I could then pass just Sections.Head to the above extractions, which would make them faster and possibly more accurate...
	- Create new high priority Memory Issues section for Diagnoses section of report (see GK note)
	- Consider making the existing Memory Issues troubleshooting steps de-emphasize RAM and stuff if there is plenty of it in there?



3. New "Low on Memory" test
    - as a new indicator for memory issues
	- new line in log summary
	- report back to Krispyroll when done, and for his review of its troubleshooting text




1. Review overlaps between Animations and Animation Loader tests. Consider reducing the overlap.

2. Consider adding System Management section (from D6DDDA issue or other?) to the "No highest0-confidence indictors found" suggestions? OR just leave that to a upcoming memory issues test?

1. New test to recommend deleting FormIDs with ReSaver:

	- Possible mod idea? https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136456
		- Doesn't allow editing, but to a technical-ish person it would probably help find a navmesh issue and isolate the mod responsible for it

	- Criticism about adding it:  https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/1168063977029382235/1326898286115688518

1. Trim down and tone down Jerilith's rules

2. Removed ‚Äúunlikely cause‚Äù when named elements are included in the list (already removed when files are in the list)

5. KERNELBASE functions with short and long versions.
	- Long version needs to have Nolvus-only instructions injected into main instructions
	- consider isolating "Apply Order" and "Reinstall Nolvus" instructions into reusable code to be shared across multiple tests
	- make sure all instructions are reconciled between Nolvus and non-Nolvus versions

6. KERNELBASE JSON Crash Detected: does the guide need to include the other configuration recommended by Roma?

7. De-Nolvus-ify ENB issue? Unless there are already two versions? And turn it into a function so it isn't so confusing to maintain. Also separate reusable code for reinstalling Nolvus (or not if I'm just linking to google doc?).



--- COMING SOON! ---





---
‚û°Ô∏è = unable to test before going live?
‚¨áÔ∏è = downgraded and added to TODO List
‚úÖ = tested and done (may have multiple levels of checkmarks depending on complexity of overall version)
---


?. Add to "no issues found":
	- text version of Safe Save Rules (with a reference link?)
	- set Windows Pagefile
	- SSD free space
	- Verify some frequently-incorrect settings ... use BGSSaveLoadManager stuff for much of this
	- Some crash logs provide more meaningful indicators than others. Try seeing if the crash repeats with the same diagnoses here, and in the Advanced Users section. 





NEXT VERSION: WORKING ON:???

	- make some tests adjust location in report, based on its isHighPriority flag. Texture/Mesh/Animation issues should be listed higher in the report if possibly relevant files were found, and lower if not found.
		- Maybe get rid of the "Memory and Image-related Issues:" section? If isHighPriority then put into "Higher-Confidence Test Results:" section, otherwise, put into "Miscellaneous Issues:" or perhaps a new "Less Likely Issues:" section?

	- If Mesh and/or Texture (and Animation?) sections are also present (and with supporting files listed), then provide links to those related test sections as often being possible/probable causes of memory issues

    - Add instructions somewhere for finding specific mods/files? Something like: "You can search for mentioned files in MO2 or in your Windows File Manager. Once isolated to a specific mod you can try disabling the mod for a quick test. Or for Mesh and Texture Issue sections of the report: In some cases simply re-downloading and reinstalling the mod with a bad mesh or texture, may fix the corrupted file and resolve the issue."

	- uniformly across appropriate test results, mention NifScan, SSE NIF Optimizer, and CAO for fixing meshes textures
	- üéØ (target emoji) doesn't seem to show up right on PC Chrome ... maybe remove them with the click-to-copy function?
		- However, this one (pasted into Notepad, and then into Reddit markup) works just fine?
			- https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1hl53vl/comment/m3lq7k0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
	- Navmesh/path test(s)? Do they troubleshoot the same?

CombatMusicFix_NG.dll. version check
Bad version 1
Fixed version 1.1
CombatMusicFix_NG.dll crashes.
Replace it with this working version instead:
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110459?tab=files
What version  is the replacement (1.1) show up as?

Source:
https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/s/YuWn9nc57t


1. ??? Remove STEAM from Overlay checks ... it just comes up too much

2. Does "List of mentioned meshes" reflect named and filename meshes from all mesh indicators? It probably should?
	- same for Utils.extractHkxPathsToListItems() ... it should also check all Animation Indicators
	- same for Utils.extractSkyrimTexturePathsToListItems ??


IN PROGRESS: 
Final steps:
- Update version number
- Review DIFFs for all changed files
- Final round of standard new version tests
- PUSH! Enough features for one version!

- Remove mentions of Nolvus from Skyrim.html version


Next:

See Google Keep notes on:
- new Animations test
- Add test for po3_PapyrusExtender version in CL/TW
	- add new function to get version number of a mod (where available)
	- refactor ConsoleUtilSSE version check code with the new function as well
- Adjust shadow description

- merge animation tests (old one into new one, with hexcode in the map)?

- for D6DDDA  test, it mentions broken meshes as a possible cause, but it doesn't list the new troubleshooting steps. Perhaps instead of rehashing them, tell them to look for the Mesh Issue description in the Advance User section for details.
	- mentioned twice? in normal and Advanced User sections?


- feasible to rewrite Named Elements section (again) to show ownership of named elements by specific files (where indicated by the log)?
	- could also same feature to list of meshes and textures reported on in various tests

- Update version number
- PUSH! Enough features for one version!

---


NEXT Version: Utils.extractNifPathsToListItems() might need to be updated with name1Regex and name2Regex values that are compatible with the syntaxes in CrashLogger or Trainwreck logs?

NEXT VERSION: For Skyrim.html, upgrade the Advanced User's High-Confidence insights into the upper, Diagnoses section of the page
	- Will probably need to wrap them in functions
	- Also, perhaps move them to a different JS file? Maybe diagnoses.js?
	- or maybe wait to do this with the big diagnoses refactoring with test data being extrapolated into data objects?
		- or maybe some tests can't be extrapolated into data objects ... making them into functions in diagnoses.js might be a good place to start at least?

NEXT VERSION: Named Elements section has some differences between NSF and CrashLogger logs. Make them match up, or at least map out why each difference exists.

NEXT VERSION: Alphabetized Load Order Test: Standard, vanilla Nolvus is almost 64% alphabetized by this metric ... perhaps it should include ESM and ESL files to decrease that number and make it a more universally useful metric across other modlists? Theoretically, I think I'd rather have the threshold set from current 70% down to like 50%?

- ‚úÖ Shorten LOOT section in Missing Masters test

‚úÖ~‚úÖ NEXT Version: GraveLord issue isn't showing up in Trainwreck Test Log? Check number of diagnoses from al three log types and make them all match up with the same test results.

‚úÖ Merge mesh issues into one (or two) tests. See in code temporary notes in comment under "General Mesh Issues" List the nifscan tool as mentioned in r/Skyrim's wiki, and already used in hair test. Also, mention "nif optimizer"
	- Most common cause is a faulty mesh that appears in that location. Confirm that all meshes are good by running them through nifscan, which may also isolate a bad mesh to a specific mod. If any are not ported you probably can fix them with "nif optimizer" or CAO
	- Can also search log for found names/filenames for meshes and try to isolate them to a specific mod. If found, you can then try disabling that mod to see if it fixes your issue.

BUGS?


- PAUSE: Why does this say Customized, but doesn't list any non-nolvus mods?
	-	BetterThirdPersonSelection - Crash_2024_4_24_13-16-36.txt
	- I'm guess they removed some vanilla mods?
	- LIKELY: Or, since they have zero extras installed, maybe my test is off?
	- rewrite BGSSaveLoadManager description to be useful, include save cleaning tool link, and don't recommend doing command kill and then potentially continuing on from a save (which could  make it worse)
	- On analyzeLog.js:   "// Check for Nolvus or Nolvus-like modlist" section, either expand the list of mods to test for, or don't make it sound so much like it's mostly Nolvus mods. (Should either be made more complex, or simplified)

- NEXT VERSION (Unused anyway): sections.Plugins isn't grabbing the right data from an applicable NSF log. In this example, it should grab just "2", but is instead grabbing "Plugin_Name: Version 1.0\nPlugin_Name: Version 1.0" ... which curiously, doesn't seem to exist in the log?

- REFACTOR: composite sections so they are just section numbers mapping to sectionMap, and make a special function to loop through the specified section numbers to search through sections of sectionsMap, and return the match along with the section number it was found in.

- REFACTOR: remove section content from sections? Only use sectionsMap?

- REFACTOR: move all log flags/identifiers into either sections or sectionsMap?
	- sections.isSkyrimPage
	- sections.hasSkyrimAE
	- sections.isNolvus
	- sections.logType
	- others?

1. SKIP or PAUSE: Skyrim Crash Analyzer probably shouldn't show any diagnoses ... just advanced user stuff?

1.2 If named elements are from the same line of a crash log, then somehow the list should reflect that. Maybe indentation? Or mabye "firstItem --> secondItem --> thirdItem"?
	- Maybe collect the lines into an array of arrays? With line number in the first array, and then numbered matches as the second array?
		- However, I think that would necessitate parsing each line differently. Currently, I'm scraping file extensions from a line, and then scraping File: and Name: from the same line ... loosing their relative order (if within the same line)


2. "You can only have one Crash Logger active at a time including NetScriptFramework (disable crash dumps in the config). If you're using NetScriptFramework, it's probably the better logger still unless you need PDB support."
	- source: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818
	- Test for which version of Skyrim is being used, looking for either of these lines:
		- Crash Logger Line 1 (0):  Skyrim SSE v1.5.97
		- NSF Line 8 (7): ApplicationName: SkyrimSE.exe
		- If not AE, then recommend NSF instead of Crash Logger
		- If AE, then recommend Crash Logger instead of NSF
	- Improve the hasSkyrimAE flag to be more accurate with check described above
	- If possible, test for multiple crash logger mods, and list them, and recommend disabling all but hte right one


- - - PAUSE - - -
1. New version of Potentially Misorganized Nolvus Plugins test:
	- A. a version worded for non-Nolvus users for ideas on how to organize their plugins
	- B. Show how far each plugin is out of order relative to what other vanilla plugins, and which vanilla plugins it expects to be above/below it
		- indicate like:  mod name.esp (out of order by 3, typically located below X and above Y)
	- C. Show what plugins it expects to be above/below it (to help manually fix the order)
	- maybe indicate extra info through "i" emoji that user can hover over?

0. New issue interface for refactored tests:
	- Hovering over the "i" emoji(s) should show additional information:
		- what indicators the test is looking for
	- Separate descriptions for both Nolvus and non-Nolvus users
	- 

1.1. Kernelbase JSON Crash change:
	- Apparently the go-to fix for this on Nolvus is to edit EngineFixes.toml ... so put #3 as a new #1 so it's the first thing users try.
	- post graphic to r/Nolvus
	- link to graphic from the analyzer
	- related: https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/755346172243214376/1260031303064223884



2. If overlay warning or virus warning is the only thing, then still show no diagnosis found. Perhaps show it if diagnosis count = 0?
4. Add the word "sequence" into Apply Order descriptions and any mention of load order for clarity? 

5. New Skyrim AE Test: ConsoleUtilSSE.dll in Probable call stack --> ConsoleUtilSSE.dll v1.4 is not compatible. Download v1.5.1 instead here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76649?tab=files
