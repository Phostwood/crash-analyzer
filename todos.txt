
1. ‚úÖStandardize errors tested in each 1, 2, 3(?) test log across the three types
2. Review all changes ... again
3. ‚úÖ Each update needs testing, indicate testing completed with a ‚úÖ on each bullet point



‚úÖ New test for too many plugin


‚úÖReorganize issues for most likely on top:
1. SKIP: Memory Issue detected out of it's own section?
2.‚úÖ Animation Issue above a bunch of stuff (this item moved to bottom of "Higher-Confidence Test Results:")
	‚úÖ- then Mesh (near top of "Memory and Image-related Issues:")
	‚úÖ- then Texture (lower in "Memory and Image-related Issues:")
	‚úÖ- then Memory Issue? (lower yet in "Memory and Image-related Issues:")
3. ‚úÖAdapt other reports to the new Utils extract code (prototype is MESH)
	- ‚úÖ Mesh
	- ‚úÖ Animations
	- ‚úÖTextures

‚úÖBeta version 0.19.3

- ‚úÖRemove Overlay warning if just steam ... it just comes up way too frequently as a false flag.

- ‚úÖNew Memory Issue test with merged (and in some ways condensed, but other ways expanded) testing and troubleshooting from several prior tests (tbbmalloc, no_alloc, bad_alloc, D6D...)
	- ‚úÖInclude troubleshooting advice specific to memory stuff, and mentions corrupted Mesh Issues and Texture Issues (elsewhere in report) as being possible causes.
	- ‚úÖRemoved separate tests for tbbmalloc, no_alloc, bad_alloc, but kept D6D as a special situation
	- ‚úÖStarted as: Greatly improved memory-issue troubleshooting ideas for:
		- ‚úÖmaybe merge these indicators into memoryIssues in crashIndicatorsMap.js and use it, and list them like I already do for meshes and such?
		- ‚úÖbe sure to include advice to try rebooting and trying to maximize available memory for Skyrim?
		- ‚úÖAdd "In some cases simply re-downloading and reinstalling the mod with a bad mesh or texture, may fix the corrupted file and resolve the issue"


  - ‚úÖ BGSSaveLoadManager Issue (Many thanks to Jerilith, RomatebitegeL, Orionis, and Krispyroll!) now has greatly expanded instructions. Decided to directly include Jerilith's safe save guide instructions. Prior permission was obtained from Jerilith.

- (‚úÖ) Removed Lanterns Of Skyrim II crash as it may be fixed now? Regardless it rarely comes up, and I've never seen it as a likely cause.

- (‚úÖ) ObjectReference Issues COMMENTED OUT as deemed generally unhelpful when it shows up. Check just thought up by AI (MS Bing Copilot anyway)

- (‚úÖ) "Many thanks to": Added more names, and alphabetized names

- ‚úÖ Allow .log in addition to .txt in the HTML log file field

- ‚úÖ KERNELBASE Crash: Revised, de-Nolvus-ified instructions for general Skyrim users, added a couple steps for all users, moved to only non-AdvancedUsers section for Skyrim users, and improve instructions overall. Did not change the test itself though.

- ‚úÖwhere no files specifically listed, for textures, meshes, and animations, say something like:  UNLIKELY CAUSE! (no animation files found in crash log ... as a last resort, consider decompressing relevant .bsa archives)

- ‚úÖ deemphasized Physics Crash with "frequently seen, but usually not the culprit"

- ‚úÖ moved some diagnostic functions out of main code block for better readability and easier maintenance

- ‚úÖ reorganized some diagnoses/insights so the most likely ones will hopefully be displayed higher up the list

- ‚úÖ removed redundant, separate ConsoleUtils version check since that's already well-handled in bulk by the DLL version checker in the top diagnoses section of the report

- ‚úÖ".bsa files may or may not contain compressed mesh files" should only show if a BSA file is listed, otherwise it is wasted text.
	- ‚¨áÔ∏èMOVED TO TODO LIST: SMALL BUG carrying over from version 0.19.3 with less common issues showing up with .bsa warning when there are no listed .bsa files:
		- ‚¨áÔ∏èHair Mod Issue
		- ‚¨áÔ∏èskee64.dll Issue (might want to merge into mesh issues anyway???)
		- ‚¨áÔ∏èCompressedArchiveStream Issue (might want to merge into text issues anyway???)


- ‚úÖ‚úÖ Removed recommendation to use Net Script Framework logging mod over CrashLoggerSSE, as I'm using CrashLoggerSSE myself, and I'm no longer confident that NSF is better for Skyrim SE

‚û°Ô∏è = unable to test before going live?
(‚úÖ) = minor change, tested only from test log


NEXT VERSION: WORKING ON:???

	- make some tests adjust location in report, based on its isHighPriority flag. Texture/Mesh/Animation issues should be listed higher in the report if possibly relevant files were found, and lower if not found.
		- Maybe get rid of the "Memory and Image-related Issues:" section? If isHighPriority then put into "Higher-Confidence Test Results:" section, otherwise, put into "Miscellaneous Issues:" or perhaps a new "Less Likely Issues:" section?

	- If Mesh and/or Texture (and Animation?) sections are also present (and with supporting files listed), then provide links to those related test sections as often being possible/probable causes of memory issues

    - Add instructions somewhere for finding specific mods/files? Something like: "You can search for mentioned files in MO2 or in your Windows File Manager. Once isolated to a specific mod you can try disabling the mod for a quick test. Or for Mesh and Texture Issue sections of the report: In some cases simply re-downloading and reinstalling the mod with a bad mesh or texture, may fix the corrupted file and resolve the issue."

	- uniformly across appropriate test results, mention NifScan, SSE NIF Optimizer, and CAO for fixing meshes textures
	- üéØ (target emoji) doesn't seem to show up right on PC Chrome ... maybe remove them with the click-to-copy function?
		- However, this one (pasted into Notepad, and then into Reddit markup) works just fine?

	- Navmesh/path test(s)? Do they troubleshoot the same?




Bug fixes/updates for Nolvus
Wording improvements and such for Nolvus
Banner ads for Nolvus version
Banner ads disabled for Patreons (if any active paid subscribers, otherwise do after Discord Helpers)
Banner ads disabled for Nolvus Discord Helpers (if this is something the Discord API allows?) ... otherwise a shared-but-secret login (if abused, I'll disable)


CombatMusicFix_NG.dll. version check
Bad version 1
Fixed version 1.1
CombatMusicFix_NG.dll crashes.
Replace it with this working version instead:
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110459?tab=files
What version  is the replacement (1.1) show up as?

Source:
https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/s/YuWn9nc57t


1. ??? Remove STEAM from Overlay checks ... it just comes up too much

2. Does "List of mentioned meshes" reflect named and filename meshes from all mesh indicators? It probably should?
	- same for Utils.extractHkxPathsToListItems() ... it should also check all Animation Indicators
	- same for Utils.extractSkyrimTexturePathsToListItems ??


IN PROGRESS: 
Final steps:
- Update version number
- Review DIFFs for all changed files
- Final round of standard new version tests
- PUSH! Enough features for one version!

- Remove mentions of Nolvus from Skyrim.html version


Next:

See Google Keep notes on:
- new Animations test
- Add test for po3_PapyrusExtender version in CL/TW
	- add new function to get version number of a mod (where available)
	- refactor ConsoleUtilSSE version check code with the new function as well
- Adjust shadow description

- merge animation tests (old one into new one, with hexcode in the map)?

- for D6DDDA  test, it mentions broken meshes as a possible cause, but it doesn't list the new troubleshooting steps. Perhaps instead of rehashing them, tell them to look for the Mesh Issue description in the Advance User section for details.
	- mentioned twice? in normal and Advanced User sections?


- feasible to rewrite Named Elements section (again) to show ownership of named elements by specific files (where indicated by the log)?
	- could also same feature to list of meshes and textures reported on in various tests

- Update version number
- PUSH! Enough features for one version!

---


NEXT Version: Utils.extractNifPathsToListItems() might need to be updated with name1Regex and name2Regex values that are compatible with the syntaxes in CrashLogger or Trainwreck logs?

NEXT VERSION: For Skyrim.html, upgrade the Advanced User's High-Confidence insights into the upper, Diagnoses section of the page
	- Will probably need to wrap them in functions
	- Also, perhaps move them to a different JS file? Maybe diagnoses.js?
	- or maybe wait to do this with the big diagnoses refactoring with test data being extrapolated into data objects?
		- or maybe some tests can't be extrapolated into data objects ... making them into functions in diagnoses.js might be a good place to start at least?

NEXT VERSION: Named Elements section has some differences between NSF and CrashLogger logs. Make them match up, or at least map out why each difference exists.

NEXT VERSION: Alphabetized Load Order Test: Standard, vanilla Nolvus is almost 64% alphabetized by this metric ... perhaps it should include ESM and ESL files to decrease that number and make it a more universally useful metric across other modlists? Theoretically, I think I'd rather have the threshold set from current 70% down to like 50%?

- ‚úÖ Shorten LOOT section in Missing Masters test

‚úÖ~‚úÖ NEXT Version: GraveLord issue isn't showing up in Trainwreck Test Log? Check number of diagnoses from al three log types and make them all match up with the same test results.

‚úÖ Merge mesh issues into one (or two) tests. See in code temporary notes in comment under "General Mesh Issues" List the nifscan tool as mentioned in r/Skyrim's wiki, and already used in hair test. Also, mention "nif optimizer"
	- Most common cause is a faulty mesh that appears in that location. Confirm that all meshes are good by running them through nifscan, which may also isolate a bad mesh to a specific mod. If any are not ported you probably can fix them with "nif optimizer" or CAO
	- Can also search log for found names/filenames for meshes and try to isolate them to a specific mod. If found, you can then try disabling that mod to see if it fixes your issue.

BUGS?


- PAUSE: Why does this say Customized, but doesn't list any non-nolvus mods?
	-	BetterThirdPersonSelection - Crash_2024_4_24_13-16-36.txt
	- I'm guess they removed some vanilla mods?
	- LIKELY: Or, since they have zero extras installed, maybe my test is off?
	- rewrite BGSSaveLoadManager description to be useful, include save cleaning tool link, and don't recommend doing command kill and then potentially continuing on from a save (which could  make it worse)
	- On analyzeLog.js:   "// Check for Nolvus or Nolvus-like modlist" section, either expand the list of mods to test for, or don't make it sound so much like it's mostly Nolvus mods. (Should either be made more complex, or simplified)

- NEXT VERSION (Unused anyway): sections.Plugins isn't grabbing the right data from an applicable NSF log. In this example, it should grab just "2", but is instead grabbing "Plugin_Name: Version 1.0\nPlugin_Name: Version 1.0" ... which curiously, doesn't seem to exist in the log?

- REFACTOR: composite sections so they are just section numbers mapping to sectionMap, and make a special function to loop through the specified section numbers to search through sections of sectionsMap, and return the match along with the section number it was found in.

- REFACTOR: remove section content from sections? Only use sectionsMap?

- REFACTOR: move all log flags/identifiers into either sections or sectionsMap?
	- sections.isSkyrimPage
	- sections.hasSkyrimAE
	- sections.isNolvus
	- sections.logType
	- others?

1. SKIP or PAUSE: Skyrim Crash Analyzer probably shouldn't show any diagnoses ... just advanced user stuff?

1.2 If named elements are from the same line of a crash log, then somehow the list should reflect that. Maybe indentation? Or mabye "firstItem --> secondItem --> thirdItem"?
	- Maybe collect the lines into an array of arrays? With line number in the first array, and then numbered matches as the second array?
		- However, I think that would necessitate parsing each line differently. Currently, I'm scraping file extensions from a line, and then scraping File: and Name: from the same line ... loosing their relative order (if within the same line)


2. "You can only have one Crash Logger active at a time including NetScriptFramework (disable crash dumps in the config). If you're using NetScriptFramework, it's probably the better logger still unless you need PDB support."
	- source: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818
	- Test for which version of Skyrim is being used, looking for either of these lines:
		- Crash Logger Line 1 (0):  Skyrim SSE v1.5.97
		- NSF Line 8 (7): ApplicationName: SkyrimSE.exe
		- If not AE, then recommend NSF instead of Crash Logger
		- If AE, then recommend Crash Logger instead of NSF
	- Improve the hasSkyrimAE flag to be more accurate with check described above
	- If possible, test for multiple crash logger mods, and list them, and recommend disabling all but hte right one


- - - PAUSE - - -
1. New version of Potentially Misorganized Nolvus Plugins test:
	- A. a version worded for non-Nolvus users for ideas on how to organize their plugins
	- B. Show how far each plugin is out of order relative to what other vanilla plugins, and which vanilla plugins it expects to be above/below it
		- indicate like:  mod name.esp (out of order by 3, typically located below X and above Y)
	- C. Show what plugins it expects to be above/below it (to help manually fix the order)
	- maybe indicate extra info through "i" emoji that user can hover over?

0. New issue interface for refactored tests:
	- Hovering over the "i" emoji(s) should show additional information:
		- what indicators the test is looking for
	- Separate descriptions for both Nolvus and non-Nolvus users
	- 

1.1. Kernelbase JSON Crash change:
	- Apparently the go-to fix for this on Nolvus is to edit EngineFixes.toml ... so put #3 as a new #1 so it's the first thing users try.
	- post graphic to r/Nolvus
	- link to graphic from the analyzer
	- related: https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/755346172243214376/1260031303064223884



2. If overlay warning or virus warning is the only thing, then still show no diagnosis found. Perhaps show it if diagnosis count = 0?
4. Add the word "sequence" into Apply Order descriptions and any mention of load order for clarity? 

5. New Skyrim AE Test: ConsoleUtilSSE.dll in Probable call stack --> ConsoleUtilSSE.dll v1.4 is not compatible. Download v1.5.1 instead here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76649?tab=files
