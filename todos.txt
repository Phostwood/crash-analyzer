✅ Beta version 0.17.1:
	✅ Refactoring and code improvements
		- Improved hasSkyrimAE flag to be more reliable
			- Turns out that Crash Logger is an unreliable  indicator of Skyrim version as it can be installed onto Skyrim SE, even though the author recommends Net Script Frameword logs instead
			- Also, longterm, Net Script Framework could potentially be updated by someone to work with AE?
		- Improvements to Test Log(s)
			- Changed name of Test Logs to reflect logType
			- Setup Test Log for CrashLogger logs (a frist draft effort ... some syntax still from NSF logs, but it still simulates the issues)
			- Updated NSF Test Log with new Simplicity of Snow + JK's Skyrim compatibility patch test
		- New sections.header log section
		- New sections.hasSkyrimAE flag
		- New sections.fullLog
		- New sections.fullLogLowerCase
		- clearer syntax to sectionsMap and farily large refactoring of affected code
		- wrapped some tests into functions (Missing Masters, Check for Novlus List, others?)
		- Bug fixes for Simplicity of Snow + JK's Skyrim compatibility patch test
		- Attempted to count ESM/ESP/ESP files ... but abandoned (commented out code) as it's impossible to determine if ESM+ESP count is over since a lot of ESPs are ESL flagged (but you can't see that in the crash log)
		- Rewrote Named Elements code to be cleaner and more efficient/effective, and fixed some bugs for CrashLogger and Trainwreck logs
		- Started some mergeIndentedLines() code, but stopped as it got overly complex. I'm still not sure of the best way to communicate the lesser importance of indented lines in CrashLogger and Trainwreck logs. I'm thinking of just using a different color for them, and maybe a different icon? Thought about merging them into into one line, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to go ... and I dind't get it work as intended anyway. Code is still there, but not being used.
		- added some more file types to Named Elements section
		- Improved console log data dump of sections and sectionsMap

	✅ New Features:
		- Now experimentally supports Trainwreck logs
		- New warning to use another log type if using Trainwreck logs (but still makes best effort with Trainwreck logs)
		- Improved, and promoted (for Skyrim.html) Missing Masters description/troubleshooting steps ... sensitive to both skyrim.html usage (vs nolvus) and to specific version of Skyrim used (if it supports latest ESL file formats, or needs BEES)
		- New test for hair mod issues, and added to Test Logs
		- Bug fix for new ConsoleUtilSSE.dll test, and added to Test Logs
		- Added 1 new and one updated text to explainerMap.js
		- Test for Nolvus-like modlist expanded to check for a percentage of mods that in in list of stable Nolvus mods (used elsewhere for determinign if a bad Nolvus load order)

	- ✅Redux
	- ✅Ultra
- ✅Test a variety of crash logs from other crash log types on Skyrim.html
	- ✅NSF

	- ✅Trainwreck
- Update list of Refactoring above after reviewing diffs for this version
- PUSH! Enough features for one version!

---

NEXT Version: GraveLord issue isn't showing up in Trainwreck Test Log? Check number of diagnoses from al three log types and make them all match up with the same test results.

NEXT Version: Utils.extractNifPathsToListItems() might need to be updated with name1Regex and name2Regex values that are compatible with the syntaxes in CrashLogger or Trainwreck logs?

NEXT Version: Merge mesh issues into one test. List the nifscan tool as mentioned in r/Skrim's wiki, and already used in hair test. Also, mention 
- Most common cause is a faulty mesh that appears in that location. Confirm that all meshes are good by running them through nifscan. If any are not ported you probably can fix them with nif optimizer.

NEXT VERSION: For Skyrim.html, upgrade the Advanced User's High-Confidence insights into the upper, Diagnoses section of the page
	- Will probalby need to wrap them in functions
	- Also, perhaps move them to a different JS file? Maybe diagnoses.js?
	- or maybe wait to do this with the big diagnoses refactoring with test data being extrapolated into data objects?
		- or maybe some tests can't be extrapolated into data objects ... making them into functions in diagnoses.js might be a good place to start at least?


✅WORKING ON:
✅Isolating Skryim Version number
✅Currently debugging hasSkyrimAE ()
✅Need to create a new sections.Header to use with hasSkyrimAE
  - ✅Don't assign color to it so it doesn't show up on named elements section
  -

✅- Crash_2024_7_14_2-10-18.txt missing BEES line in Missing Masters test
✅- CrashLogger - erQyRxDL.tx error!
✅- When loading Trainwreck, needs to set pulldown to Trainwreck

✅- Working on new Vanilla Hair Remake test as suggested by https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1e1ai7t/comment/lcw4urr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
✅- Add to Test Logs: Hair Issue test indicators

✅WORKING ON: clearer syntax to sectionsMap and refactoring of affected code
- ✅bug fix where uncolorized section (header) was showing up in the Named Elements section of the Log Summary


- ✅Skyrim.html logType pulldown needs to include Trainwreck as an option
- ✅ Make TestLogTrainwreck1 in a more Trainwreck-ish format

- ✅Test new version of Missing Masters 2.1 test (✅and remove old if new is better)


- ✅trying to figure out why Trainwreck/CrashLogger logs are producing colorless, "[0]" elements in Named Files/Elements section of the Log Summary
	- ✅Also, why is firstLine being skipped in this description?
		✅"listed within [2] Probable call stack, [3] Registers, and/or [4] Stack section"
	- ✅Also, build a better console log dump for the sections and sectionsMap
		- ✅needs to include priority, color, etc along with the matched text
	- ✅And maybe create a better way of building the sections and sectionsMap in a way that makes more sense (and/or can be output more easily to the Console Log?)

- NEVERMIND (it's gamePlugins section is empty due to being a Missing Masters crash): "Needs Bees for translation mods - Crash_2024_7_14_2-10-18.txt" is not showing the Nolvus info when loaded from the Skyrim analyzer

✅- Test changes to ConsoleUtilSSE.dll test
✅- Add ConsoleUtilSSE.dll test to Test Log for CrashLogger and Trainwreck logs and NSF logs (but not Nolvus, which already has correct version of ConsoleUtilSSE.dll baked in)

- ✅DONE: debugging "use Test Log" link with new feature to detect tye right test log for the right logType

✅Trainwreck compatibility?
	- ✅define sections for Trainwreck
	- ✅add to logType
	- ✅add a diagnosis warning for Trainwreck

✅New Test Logs:
	- TestLogCrashLogger1.txt
	- TestLogCrashLogger2.txt
	- TestLogTrainwreck1.txt
	- TestLogTrainwreck2.txt

- ✅make Missing Masters a diagnosis for Skyrim.html but keep it an Advanced Users insight for Nolvus



BUGS?

- ✅Finish adding new Missing Masters description:
	- MO2 warning doesn't always show up
	- PAUSE FOR Non-NOLVUS DESCRIPTIONS: LOOT might be helpful?
	- Sometimes using the wrong version of a mod (like one meant for Skyrim 1.6 instead of 1.5) can cause this:
		- https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/1168063977029382235/1259668672583041064
		- https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/1168063977029382235/1259706207644418048

- ✅Skryim version should recommend that Nolvus users use the Nolvus-specific version of the analyzer (... )and vice versa?)


- PAUSE: Why does this say Cusomized, but doesn't list any non-nolvus mods?
	-	BetterThirdPersonSelection - Crash_2024_4_24_13-16-36.txt
	- I'm guess they removed some vanilla mods?
	- LIKELY: Or, since they have zero extras installed, maybe my test is off?
	- rewrite BGSSaveLoadManager description to be useful, include save cleaning tool link, and don't recommend doing command kill and then potentially continuing on from a save (which could  make it worse)
	- On analyzeLog.js:   "// Check for Nolvus or Nolvus-like modlist" section, either expand the list of mods to test for, or don't make it sound so much like it's mostly Nolvus mods. (Should either be made more complex, or simplified)

- NEXT VERSION (Unused anyway): sections.Plugins isn't grabbing the right data from an applicable NSF log. In this example, it should grab just "2", but is instead grabbing "Plugin_Name: Version 1.0\nPlugin_Name: Version 1.0" ... which curiously, doesn't seem to exist in the log?

- REFACTOR: composite sections so they are just section numbers mapping to sectionMap, and make a special function to loop through the specified section numbers to search through sections of sectionsMap, and return the match along with the section number it was found in.

- REFACTOR: remove section content from sections? Only use sectionsMap?

- REFACTOR: move all log flags/indentifiers into either sections or sectionsMap?
	- sections.isSkyrimPage
	- secsectionstoins.hasSkyrimAE
	- sections.isNolvus
	- sections.logType
	- others?

1. SKIP or PAUSE: Skyrim Crash Analyzer probably shouldn't show any diagnoses ... just advanced user stuff?

1.2 If named elements are from the same line of a crash log, then somehow the list should reflect that. Maybe indentation? Or mabye "firstItem --> secondItem --> thirdItem"?
	- Maybe collect the lines into an array of arrays? With line number in the first array, and then numbered matches as the second array?
		- However, I think that would necessitate parsing each line differently. Currently, I'm scraping file extensions from a line, and then scraping File: and Name: from the same line ... loosing their relative order (if within the same line)


2. "You can only have one Crash Logger active at a time including NetScriptFramework (disable crash dumps in the config). If you're using NetScriptFramework, it's probably the better logger still unless you need PDB support."
	- source: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818
	- Test for which version of Skyrim is being used, looking for either of these lines:
		- Crash Logger Line 1 (0):  Skyrim SSE v1.5.97
		- NSF Line 8 (7): ApplicationName: SkyrimSE.exe
		- If not AE, then recommend NSF instead of Crash Logger
		- If AE, then recommend Crash Logger instead of NSF
	- Improve the hasSkyrimAE flag to be more accurate with check described above
	- If possible, test for multiple crash logger mods, and list them, and recommend disabling all but hte right one


- - - PAUSE - - -
1. New version of Potentially Misorganized Nolvus Plugins test:
	- A. a version worded for non-Nolvus users for ideas on how to organize their plugins
	- B. Show how far each plugin is out of order relative to what other vanilla plugins, and which vanilla plugins it expects to be above/below it
		- indicate like:  modname.esp (out of order by 3, typically located below X and above Y)
	- C. Show what plugins it expects to be above/below it (to help manually fix the order)
	- maybe indicate extra info through "i" emoji that user can hover over?

0. New issue interface for refactored tests:
	- Hovering over the "i" emoji(s) should show additional informaiton:
		- what indicators the test is looking for
	- Separate descriptions for both Nolvus and non-Nolvus users
	- 

1.1. Kernelbase JSON Crash change:
	- Aparently the go-to fix for this on Nolvus is to edit EngineFixes.toml ... so put #3 as a new #1 so it's the first thing users try.
	- post graphic to r/Nolvus
	- link to graphic from the analyzer
	- related: https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/755346172243214376/1260031303064223884



2. If overlay warning or virus warning is the only thing, then still show no diagnosis found. Perhaps show it if diagnosis count = 0?
4. Add the word "sequence" into Apply Order descriptions and any mention of load order for clarity? 

5. New Skyrim AE Test: ConsoleUtilSSE.dll in Probable call stack --> ConsoleUtilSSE.dll v1.4 is not compatible. Download v1.5.1 instead here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76649?tab=files
