✅ Beta version 0.17.2:

	✅ New Features:
		- Tests for common mods that are incompatible with Skyrim AE 1.6.1130 and later
			- Currently spots and recommends upgrades for ConsoleUtilSSE, QuickLootRE, po3_PapyrusExtender, and DynamicAnimationReplacer
		- New animation issues test with troubleshooting tips
		- Merged 7 mesh-related tests into one large, more refined test with better troubleshooting steps.
		- Alphabetized Load Order test now has a new troubleshooting description for Skyrim.html users (non-Nolvus users)

	✅ Refactoring and code improvements
		-Removed experimental code for counting ESM+ESP files, since it can never be made accurate from just crash logs due to some ESP files being (invisibly to crash logs) flagged as ESL files. Vanilla Nolvus includes like thousands of these ESL-flagged ESP files.
		- New contextual, standardized statements for adding to troubleshooting descriptions:
			- Utils.LootWarningForNolvus
			- Utils.LootIfSkyrim
			- Utils.LootListItemIfSkyrim
		- Using above, shortened Loot description in Missing Masters test
		- Loosened the test for .STRINGS crash to not be specific to R14 line.
			- From an "Everything" app search, it appears that ".STRINGS" never occurs in any other context in the log. All occurrences were String crashes. I was concerned that different log types (CrashLogger, Trainwreck) might not keep it on a line with the same "R14" text, so I decided to loosen up the test. If this causes false positives, I'll have to tighten it back up.
		- Fixed several other tests and Test Logs for better compatibility with CrashLogger/Trainwreck logs
		- New data-structure for storing crash types:  crashIndicatorsMap.js
		- Fixed minor layout issue in Overlay test description
		- Fixed minor layout issue in Physics test description, and removed Nolvus line for Skyrim.html users
		- New contextual standardized Utils.NolvusOrSkyrimText variable for returning "Nolvus" or "Skyrim" depending on the page being used.
		- A first round of general changes towards making Skyrim.html mention Nolvus a lot less 


NEXT VERSION: WORKING ON:
1. Remove STEAM from Overlay checks ... it just comes up too much

2. Does "List of mentioned meshes" reflect named and filename meshes from all mesh indicators? It probably should?


Revise Animations test text:
https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1e4gy2u/comment/ldp85c5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button


Initial testing of new DLL version checker.
Add other DLLs for version checking?

I'm guessing code outside of my new Utils.compareVersions() function is causing this? Need to rewrite other sections? The comments and variable/function names don't always make sense, and that is probably throwing off AI code writing, regardless of my outside-of-code instructions?
	NEW BUG in "update CU and PPE - 3kiuNJZH.txt"
		"ConsoleUtilSSE.dll v1.5.1: Recommend update to ConsoleUtilSSE NG v1.5.1 "

	NEW BUG in "Incompatible CU - Trainwreck - 2024-07-11-16-13-36.log.txt"
		1.5.1 already installed, but cited as needing updated:
	




BUG: Maybe with CrashLogger DLL version detection?

	z5ipuuuK - QuickLootRE and ConsoleUtilSSE.txt 
	- seems to correctly show QuickLootRE.dll v2.15 and po3_PapyrusExtender.dll v5.6.2.1
	- but doesn't show error for ConsoleUtilSSE.dll v1.4
		- it isn't equating 1.4 as being the same as 1.4.0 ... NEEDS FIXED
		- ABOVE IS FIXED, but now po3_PapyrusExtender.dll v5.6.2.1 isn't showing up

	Gazimir SSE Crash Log - po3_PapyrusExtender.txt
	- doesn't show error for po3_PapyrusExtender.dll v5.6.1.1 ... which is below the listed '5.6.2.1'


IN PROGRESS: 
Final steps:
- Update version number
- Review DIFFs for all changed files
- Final round of standard new version tests
- PUSH! Enough features for one version!

- Remove mentions of Nolvus from Skyrim.html version


Next:

See Google Keep notes on:
- new Animations test
- Add test for po3_PapyrusExtender version in CL/TW
	- add new function to get version number of a mod (where available)
	- refactor ConsoleUtilSSE version check code with the new function as well
- Adjust shadow description

- merge animation tests (old one into new one, with hexcode in the map)?

- for D6DDDA  test, it mentions broken meshes as a possible cause, but it doesn't list the new troubleshooting steps. Perhaps instead of rehashing them, tell them to look for the Mesh Issue description in the Advance User section for details.
	- mentioned twice? in normal and Advanced User sections?


- feasible to rewrite Named Elements section (again) to show ownership of named elements by specific files (where indicated by the log)?
	- could also same feature to list of meshes and textures reported on in various tests

- Update version number
- PUSH! Enough features for one version!

---

NEXT VERSION? Turns out mod versions can be scraped from Crash Logger Logs, and the ConsoleUtilSSE test can be made a bit smarter:
(Unsure about Trainwreck logs? Maybe no longer recommend NSF over CL for Skyrim SE 1.5 users?)
	SKSE PLUGINS:
		ActorLimitFix.dll
		AHZmoreHUDInventory.dll v2.1.3
		AHZmoreHUDPlugin.dll v5.2.2
		AlternateConversationCamera.dll
		AnimationQueueFix.dll v1.0.1
		BetterJumpingSE.dll
		BugFixesSSE.dll
		ConsoleUtilSSE.dll v1.4


NEXT Version: Utils.extractNifPathsToListItems() might need to be updated with name1Regex and name2Regex values that are compatible with the syntaxes in CrashLogger or Trainwreck logs?

NEXT VERSION: For Skyrim.html, upgrade the Advanced User's High-Confidence insights into the upper, Diagnoses section of the page
	- Will probably need to wrap them in functions
	- Also, perhaps move them to a different JS file? Maybe diagnoses.js?
	- or maybe wait to do this with the big diagnoses refactoring with test data being extrapolated into data objects?
		- or maybe some tests can't be extrapolated into data objects ... making them into functions in diagnoses.js might be a good place to start at least?

NEXT VERSION: Named Elements section has some differences between NSF and CrashLogger logs. Make them match up, or at least map out why each difference exists.

NEXT VERSION: Alphabetized Load Order Test: Standard, vanilla Nolvus is almost 64% alphabetized by this metric ... perhaps it should include ESM and ESL files to decrease that number and make it a more universally useful metric across other modlists? Theoretically, I think I'd rather have the threshold set from current 70% down to like 50%?

- ✅ Shorten LOOT section in Missing Masters test

✅~✅ NEXT Version: GraveLord issue isn't showing up in Trainwreck Test Log? Check number of diagnoses from al three log types and make them all match up with the same test results.

✅ Merge mesh issues into one (or two) tests. See in code temporary notes in comment under "General Mesh Issues" List the nifscan tool as mentioned in r/Skyrim's wiki, and already used in hair test. Also, mention "nif optimizer"
	- Most common cause is a faulty mesh that appears in that location. Confirm that all meshes are good by running them through nifscan, which may also isolate a bad mesh to a specific mod. If any are not ported you probably can fix them with "nif optimizer" or CAO
	- Can also search log for found names/filenames for meshes and try to isolate them to a specific mod. If found, you can then try disabling that mod to see if it fixes your issue.

BUGS?


- PAUSE: Why does this say Customized, but doesn't list any non-nolvus mods?
	-	BetterThirdPersonSelection - Crash_2024_4_24_13-16-36.txt
	- I'm guess they removed some vanilla mods?
	- LIKELY: Or, since they have zero extras installed, maybe my test is off?
	- rewrite BGSSaveLoadManager description to be useful, include save cleaning tool link, and don't recommend doing command kill and then potentially continuing on from a save (which could  make it worse)
	- On analyzeLog.js:   "// Check for Nolvus or Nolvus-like modlist" section, either expand the list of mods to test for, or don't make it sound so much like it's mostly Nolvus mods. (Should either be made more complex, or simplified)

- NEXT VERSION (Unused anyway): sections.Plugins isn't grabbing the right data from an applicable NSF log. In this example, it should grab just "2", but is instead grabbing "Plugin_Name: Version 1.0\nPlugin_Name: Version 1.0" ... which curiously, doesn't seem to exist in the log?

- REFACTOR: composite sections so they are just section numbers mapping to sectionMap, and make a special function to loop through the specified section numbers to search through sections of sectionsMap, and return the match along with the section number it was found in.

- REFACTOR: remove section content from sections? Only use sectionsMap?

- REFACTOR: move all log flags/identifiers into either sections or sectionsMap?
	- sections.isSkyrimPage
	- sections.hasSkyrimAE
	- sections.isNolvus
	- sections.logType
	- others?

1. SKIP or PAUSE: Skyrim Crash Analyzer probably shouldn't show any diagnoses ... just advanced user stuff?

1.2 If named elements are from the same line of a crash log, then somehow the list should reflect that. Maybe indentation? Or mabye "firstItem --> secondItem --> thirdItem"?
	- Maybe collect the lines into an array of arrays? With line number in the first array, and then numbered matches as the second array?
		- However, I think that would necessitate parsing each line differently. Currently, I'm scraping file extensions from a line, and then scraping File: and Name: from the same line ... loosing their relative order (if within the same line)


2. "You can only have one Crash Logger active at a time including NetScriptFramework (disable crash dumps in the config). If you're using NetScriptFramework, it's probably the better logger still unless you need PDB support."
	- source: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818
	- Test for which version of Skyrim is being used, looking for either of these lines:
		- Crash Logger Line 1 (0):  Skyrim SSE v1.5.97
		- NSF Line 8 (7): ApplicationName: SkyrimSE.exe
		- If not AE, then recommend NSF instead of Crash Logger
		- If AE, then recommend Crash Logger instead of NSF
	- Improve the hasSkyrimAE flag to be more accurate with check described above
	- If possible, test for multiple crash logger mods, and list them, and recommend disabling all but hte right one


- - - PAUSE - - -
1. New version of Potentially Misorganized Nolvus Plugins test:
	- A. a version worded for non-Nolvus users for ideas on how to organize their plugins
	- B. Show how far each plugin is out of order relative to what other vanilla plugins, and which vanilla plugins it expects to be above/below it
		- indicate like:  mod name.esp (out of order by 3, typically located below X and above Y)
	- C. Show what plugins it expects to be above/below it (to help manually fix the order)
	- maybe indicate extra info through "i" emoji that user can hover over?

0. New issue interface for refactored tests:
	- Hovering over the "i" emoji(s) should show additional information:
		- what indicators the test is looking for
	- Separate descriptions for both Nolvus and non-Nolvus users
	- 

1.1. Kernelbase JSON Crash change:
	- Apparently the go-to fix for this on Nolvus is to edit EngineFixes.toml ... so put #3 as a new #1 so it's the first thing users try.
	- post graphic to r/Nolvus
	- link to graphic from the analyzer
	- related: https://discord.com/channels/740569699900719145/755346172243214376/1260031303064223884



2. If overlay warning or virus warning is the only thing, then still show no diagnosis found. Perhaps show it if diagnosis count = 0?
4. Add the word "sequence" into Apply Order descriptions and any mention of load order for clarity? 

5. New Skyrim AE Test: ConsoleUtilSSE.dll in Probable call stack --> ConsoleUtilSSE.dll v1.4 is not compatible. Download v1.5.1 instead here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76649?tab=files
