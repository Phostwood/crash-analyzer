✅ Beta version 0.16.2:
	✅ Large Refactoring:
		- 

	✅ New Features:
		- New Utils.hasSkyrimAE flag to indicate if the user has Skyrim AE installed
		- Missing Masters: now has different tests depdending on Utils.hasSkyrimAE, and checks for AE-specific indicator (as mentioned by r/SkyrimMods automoderator/bot)
		- Copy-paste link for sharing results:
			- Skyrim.html now shares the correct skyrim.html link
			- 


DO NOW: set up version control for this project, and hopefully tie it into gitHub.com. Will need to rearch how to do this and/or ask AI for help.





BUGS?
- ✅ Collapsed Overlay still shows steam?

 - ✅What to do with logs like " NVIDIA Overclocked - Crash_2024_5_4_21-52-31.txt" where they have this mark up (or for some reason different) log headings for the first two sectoins:
		- Possible relevant objects (0)
			{
			}

			Probable callstack (old method)
			{
		- search for other logs ... there are at least two that do this. For the old log parsing it still sort of worked, but it breaks the new log parsing.


- ✅ Files/Elements list isn't using explainersMap. Fix.

- ✅Line Counts are off by 2. Fix.
	- ✅double checking bugs, both for nsf and cl logs
	- ✅Game Plugins for nsf is off by 1
	- ✅Plugins for nsf isn't showing in the list? no match?

- ✅Two missing tests when using the Test Log under the Advanced Users section:
	- ✅Under "ENB Issue Detected" ... there should be a "Potential Misorganization of Vanilla Nolvus Plugins" section when using the Test Log. Why isn't is showing up? Fix

	- ✅ALSO missing "Non-Nolvus Plugins Detected at Bottom" section with new code. Fix.

- ✅WRONG NUMBER: "❗Non-Nolvus Plugins Detected at Bottom: 0 Non-Nolvus plugins"
	... ✅should be 219
	- ✅just needs a second, more thorough QA check

- ✅Finish adding new Missing Masters description:
	- MO2 warning doesn't always show up
	- LOOT might be helpful?
	- Sometimes using the wrong version of a mod (like one meant for Skyrim 1.6 instead of 1.5) can cause this:

- ✅Skryim version should recommend that Nolvus users use the Nolvus-specific version of the analyzer (... )and vice versa?)

- NEXT VERSION: Create a Crash Logger Test Log v0.1

- PAUSE: Why does this say Cusomized, but doesn't list any non-nolvus mods?
	-	BetterThirdPersonSelection - Crash_2024_4_24_13-16-36.txt
	- I'm guess they removed some vanilla mods?
	- LIKELY: Or, since they have zero extras installed, maybe my test is off?
	- rewrite BGSSaveLoadManager description to be useful, include save cleaning tool link, and don't recommend doing command kill and then potentially continuing on from a save (which could  make it worse)
	- On analyzeLog.js:   "// Check for Nolvus or Nolvus-like modlist" section, either expand the list of mods to test for, or don't make it sound so much like it's mostly Nolvus mods. (Should either be made more complex, or simplified)
   

Todos:
✅0. Crash Loggers "first line" is actually on line 4. Need to fix this.



0. ✅?? Crashlogger is usually at this location. C***\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE

		- RomatebitegeL: "Crash Logger logs are usually located in my documents and settings, my games, Skyrim Special Edition, SKSE folder."

1. SKIP or PAUSE: Skyrim Crash Analyzer probably shouldn't show any diagnoses ... just advanced user stuff?

1. ✅Updated "Mising Master 2" test to include a new potential flag: 'SettingT<INISettingCollection>*'
	- Apparnetly, [RSP+3E0] 0x7FF605242620     (SettingT<INISettingCollection>*) in the Stack setion is an indication of a Missing Masters: 
	- test for "SettingT<INISettingCollection>" in tophalf section.
		- Usually (SettingT<INISettingCollection>*) means missing masters. It can also mean Backported Extended ESL Support mod is needed for downgrades.
		- In that case [using Vortex], some patch may be broken, or something is still missing. What you can do is open LOOT and see if it mentions anything. Then install what it mentions.
		- If it still don't work, from experience, some patch may be broken and give this reference. This is what has occurred to others with the same kind of logs.
		- So you may have to go over your mods in that case.

		- Appears to also apply to NSF logs: https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1dw3xsi/getting_a_ctd_when_launching_skyrim_havent/
			- Verified as found in Missing Masters Nolvus Log: "Missing Masters - Crash_2024_5_6_16-32-26.txt"
				- maybe just add this as a second thing to look for in Missing Master test(s)?
				- More Nolvus examples with it:
					- missing master - Crash_2024_4_12_20-31-30.txt
					- MissingMaster - Crash_2024_4_13_2-56-9.txt
					- Missing Masters - Crash_2024_4_22_8-56-58.txt
					- MissingMaster - Crash_2024_4_26_4-32-49.txt


* Fit this code somewhere so if Net Script Framework ever gets updated for AE:
			if (Utils.hasSkyrimAE) {
				pageTitle.textContent = "Phostwood's Skyrim AE Crash Log Analyzer";
			} else {
				pageTitle.textContent = "Phostwood's Skyrim SE Crash Log Analyzer";
			}


2. "You can only have one Crash Logger active at a time including NetScriptFramework (disable crash dumps in the config). If you're using NetScriptFramework, it's probably the better logger still unless you need PDB support."
	- source: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818
	- Test for which version of Skyrim is being used, looking for either of these lines:
		- Crash Logger Line 1 (0):  Skyrim SSE v1.5.97
		- NSF Line 8 (7): ApplicationName: SkyrimSE.exe
		- If not AE, then recommend NSF instead of Crash Logger
		- If AE, then recommend Crash Logger instead of NSF
	- Improve the hasSkyrimAE flag to be more accurate with check described above
	- If possible, test for multiple crash logger mods, and list them, and recommend disabling all but hte right one


- - - PAUSE - - -
1. New version of Potentially Misorganized Nolvus Plugins test:
	- A. a version worded for non-Nolvus users for ideas on how to organize their plugins
	- B. Show how far each plugin is out of order relative to what other vanilla plugins, and which vanilla plugins it expects to be above/below it
		- indicate like:  modname.esp (out of order by 3, typically located below X and above Y)
	- C. Show what plugins it expects to be above/below it (to help manually fix the order)
	- maybe indicate extra info through "i" emoji that user can hover over?

0. New issue interface for refactored tests:
	- Hovering over the "i" emoji(s) should show additional informaiton:
		- what indicators the test is looking for
	- Separate descriptions for both Nolvus and non-Nolvus users
	- 

1.1. Kernelbase JSON Crash change:
	- Aparently the go-to fix for this on Nolvus is to edit EngineFixes.toml ... so put #3 as a new #1 so it's the first thing users try.
	- post graphic to r/Nolvus
	- link to graphic from the analyzer

2. If overlay warning or virsus warning is the only thing, then still show no diagnosis found. Perhaps show it if diagnosis count = 0?
3. Lots more changes recently to add to Refactoring
4. Add the word "sequence" into Apply Order descriptions and any mention of load order for clarity? 

5. New Skyrim AE Test: ConsoleUtilSSE.dll in Probable call stack --> ConsoleUtilSSE.dll v1.4 is not compatible. Download v1.5.1 instead here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76649?tab=files
