✅ Beta version 0.16.3:
	✅ Refactoring:
		- 

	✅ New Features:
		- New test for Simplicity of Snow and JK's Skyrim comaptibility patch







BUGS?
 - ✅What to do with logs like " NVIDIA Overclocked - Crash_2024_5_4_21-52-31.txt" where they have this mark up (or for some reason different) log headings for the first two sectoins:
		- Possible relevant objects (0)
			{
			}

			Probable callstack (old method)
			{
		- search for other logs ... there are at least two that do this. For the old log parsing it still sort of worked, but it breaks the new log parsing.


- ✅Finish adding new Missing Masters description:
	- MO2 warning doesn't always show up
	- PAUSE FOR Non-NOLVUS DESCRIPTIONS: LOOT might be helpful?
	- Sometimes using the wrong version of a mod (like one meant for Skyrim 1.6 instead of 1.5) can cause this:

- ✅Skryim version should recommend that Nolvus users use the Nolvus-specific version of the analyzer (... )and vice versa?)

- NEXT VERSION: Create a Crash Logger Test Log v0.1

- PAUSE: Why does this say Cusomized, but doesn't list any non-nolvus mods?
	-	BetterThirdPersonSelection - Crash_2024_4_24_13-16-36.txt
	- I'm guess they removed some vanilla mods?
	- LIKELY: Or, since they have zero extras installed, maybe my test is off?
	- rewrite BGSSaveLoadManager description to be useful, include save cleaning tool link, and don't recommend doing command kill and then potentially continuing on from a save (which could  make it worse)
	- On analyzeLog.js:   "// Check for Nolvus or Nolvus-like modlist" section, either expand the list of mods to test for, or don't make it sound so much like it's mostly Nolvus mods. (Should either be made more complex, or simplified)
   

Todos:

1. SKIP or PAUSE: Skyrim Crash Analyzer probably shouldn't show any diagnoses ... just advanced user stuff?


1.1 Fit this code somewhere so if Net Script Framework ever gets updated for AE:
			if (Utils.hasSkyrimAE) {
				pageTitle.textContent = "Phostwood's Skyrim AE Crash Log Analyzer";
			} else {
				pageTitle.textContent = "Phostwood's Skyrim SE Crash Log Analyzer";
			}

1.2 If named elements are from the same line of a crash log, then somehow the list should reflect that. Maybe indentation? Or mabye "firstItem --> secondItem --> thirdItem"?
	- Maybe collect the lines into an array of arrays? With line number in the first array, and then numbered matches as the second array?
		- However, I think that would necessitate parsing each line differently. Currently, I'm scraping file extensions from a line, and then scraping File: and Name: from the same line ... loosing their relative order (if within the same line)


2. "You can only have one Crash Logger active at a time including NetScriptFramework (disable crash dumps in the config). If you're using NetScriptFramework, it's probably the better logger still unless you need PDB support."
	- source: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818
	- Test for which version of Skyrim is being used, looking for either of these lines:
		- Crash Logger Line 1 (0):  Skyrim SSE v1.5.97
		- NSF Line 8 (7): ApplicationName: SkyrimSE.exe
		- If not AE, then recommend NSF instead of Crash Logger
		- If AE, then recommend Crash Logger instead of NSF
	- Improve the hasSkyrimAE flag to be more accurate with check described above
	- If possible, test for multiple crash logger mods, and list them, and recommend disabling all but hte right one

1. New version of Potentially Misorganized Nolvus Plugins test:
	- A. a version worded for non-Nolvus users for ideas on how to organize their plugins
	- B. Show how far each plugin is out of order relative to what other vanilla plugins, and which vanilla plugins it expects to be above/below it
		- indicate like:  modname.esp (out of order by 3, typically located below X and above Y)
	- C. Show what plugins it expects to be above/below it (to help manually fix the order)
	- maybe indicate extra info through "i" emoji that user can hover over?

0. New issue interface for refactored tests:
	- Hovering over the "i" emoji(s) should show additional informaiton:
		- what indicators the test is looking for
	- Separate descriptions for both Nolvus and non-Nolvus users
	- 

1.1. Kernelbase JSON Crash change:
	- Aparently the go-to fix for this on Nolvus is to edit EngineFixes.toml ... so put #3 as a new #1 so it's the first thing users try.
	- post graphic to r/Nolvus
	- link to graphic from the analyzer

2. If overlay warning or virsus warning is the only thing, then still show no diagnosis found. Perhaps show it if diagnosis count = 0?
3. Lots more changes recently to add to Refactoring
4. Add the word "sequence" into Apply Order descriptions and any mention of load order for clarity? 

5. New Skyrim AE Test: ConsoleUtilSSE.dll in Probable call stack --> ConsoleUtilSSE.dll v1.4 is not compatible. Download v1.5.1 instead here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76649?tab=files
