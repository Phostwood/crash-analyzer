# Phostwood's Crash Analyzers:

With over 600 hours of ongoing development, these advanced analyzers examine Nolvus and general Skyrim crash logs to help diagnose and fix 75-90% of crashes with identifiable causes, providing well-researched troubleshooting steps and links. It's currently helping almost 200 different Skyrim modders each day, and stands apart from other automated analyzers with its advanced diagnoses, detailed troubleshooting steps (for common crash types) and frequent updates.
While not a replacement for talented human crash log readers, it works much faster and, when used judiciously, can free up these rare experts to focus on the more challenging crash logs that require human analysis. 


**The Value of Automation:**
I've developed my Phostwood's Skyrim Crash Log Analyzers to address a significant need in our modding community. **Each day**, the tool assists an average of over **200 Skyrim modders** with diagnosing over **325 different crash logs** â€” far more than the volunteers in all of our communities could competently, manually handle. Detailed analysis of crash logs containing thousands of lines is precisely the kind of task that benefits from automation, especially given how few community members have both the expertise and available time and energy to regularly assist others with crash log interpretation.

And again, this analyzer is not intended to replace the invaluable expertise of the skilled manual crash log readers in our Skyrim modding communities. These experts are truly worth their weight in gold Septims! My goal is to free up more of their time so they can focus on the tricky logs where automated analysis is less helpful.
