                <h2>Sovnkrasch — Crash Log Upload &amp; Storage Service</h2>
                <p>Sovnkrasch is an optional cloud storage service, accessed via <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/173224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phostwood's QLP</a>, that allows you to upload and share your Skyrim crash logs. The following terms apply when you use them.</p>

                <h3>You Are Sharing Publicly</h3>
                <p>When you upload a crash log to Sovnkrasch, you are sharing it with the world. Stored crash logs should not be considered private — links to them could be shared from anywhere, and we have no way to control who accesses a log once its link is shared. Do not upload crash logs containing information you consider sensitive or private.</p>

                <h3>License Grant</h3>
                <p>By uploading a crash log via Phostwood's QLP, you grant us permission to store, share, and use that log for purposes related to this project and the broader Skyrim crash analysis community. This includes the possibility that stored logs may be used to improve this or related Skyrim crash analysis projects, or shared with trusted collaborators working on such projects. We do not sell crash log data.</p>

                <h3>Anonymization &amp; Redaction</h3>
                <p>Before storage, the Sovnkrasch server automatically attempts to redact potentially sensitive information from your crash log, including Windows usernames in file paths, machine names, IP addresses, and email addresses. However, this redaction is best-effort and cannot be guaranteed to be complete. Skyrim crash logs are generally pretty innocuous by nature, but please be aware that perfect anonymization is not guaranteed.</p>

                <h3>Retention &amp; Deletion</h3>
                <p>Crash logs are retained as long as needed to support the service. Log deletion is not currently supported — once a crash log is uploaded, we are unable to remove individual logs on request unless you can provide the specific UUID link for your stored log, and even then this would require a manual process we cannot commit to. Please upload only crash logs you are comfortable sharing indefinitely.</p>

                <h3>No Guarantees</h3>
                <p>Sovnkrasch is provided as a free, best-effort service. <strong>No guarantees are made regarding uptime, data retention, security, or the completeness of redaction.</strong> Reasonable precautions have been taken to prevent unauthorized access and abuse, but this is a hobbyist-operated service, not a hardened commercial platform. Use at your own risk.</p>

                <h3>Skyrim Crash Logs Only</h3>
                <p>Sovnkrasch is intended solely for authentic Skyrim SE/AE crash logs. The service makes reasonable technical attempts to filter out non-Skyrim content, but this filtering cannot be guaranteed to be perfect. Please use it only for its intended purpose. Additionally, users are expected not to upload any illegal content.</p>

                <h3>User-Generated Content &amp; Abuse</h3>
                <p>Sovnkrasch is a shared, open upload service. While we make reasonable technical efforts to filter out non-Skyrim content and prevent abuse, we have very limited control over what users choose to upload. By design, any valid-looking Skyrim crash log can be submitted — including logs shared by or between users who did not generate them themselves. Please be aware that uploaded logs may reference mods with NSFW, adult, or otherwise objectionable content, as we do not screen for this. Additionally, some mods referenced in crash logs may be controversial or even restricted or illegal in certain jurisdictions — we make no attempt to filter for these either.</p>
                <p><strong>We cannot be held responsible for content uploaded by others.</strong> If you encounter a stored log referencing illegal content, please report it via our <a href="https://discord.gg/Wnsgra4B8Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord channel</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Phostwood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">r/Phostwood</a> and we will review it on a best-effort basis.</p>
