                <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
                <p>Phostwood's Skyrim Crash Log Analyzer is designed with your privacy in mind. <strong>All crash log analysis happens entirely on your device</strong> — your crash logs never leave your computer or device.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>What We Collect</h2>
                <p><strong>We collect nothing about you personally.</strong> Here's what does happen:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Analysis Only:</strong> Your crash logs are analyzed entirely within your browser. They are never uploaded to any server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crash Log Hashes:</strong> We store a unique identifying number (hash) of each crash log you analyze in your browser's local storage for Google Analytics. This helps us track how many unique crashes each user has analyzed, but the hash contains no personal information and cannot be reversed to reveal your crash log contents.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>No AI Processing of Your Data</h2>
                <p><strong>Your crash logs are never automatically sent to any AI service.</strong> While AI (primarily Claude AI) was used as a development assistant to help write code and troubleshooting instructions, all code was written from our specific instructions and has been manually reviewed and edited by us. Similarly, all troubleshooting instructions began as our rough notes on what to include, were reviewed by us, and often refined in collaboration with Skyrim crash log experts for completeness and accuracy. All AI contributions were made during development only. The final analyzer is static code that runs entirely in your browser — there is no dynamic connection to any AI service, and your crash logs are never transmitted to AI systems for analysis or any other purpose.</p>
                <p>In the future, we may offer an optional feature that allows you to send crash log data to an AI service for additional analysis. Any such feature will be clearly labeled, completely optional, and will require your explicit action to use. We will never send your data to AI services without your knowledge and consent.</p>

                <h2>Crash Log Upload Feature (MO2 Plugin)</h2>
                <p>If you use the optional MO2 plugin to upload a crash log for sharing, the following applies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Redaction:</strong> Before storage, the server automatically redacts potentially sensitive information such as Windows usernames embedded in file paths, IP addresses, and email addresses.</li>
                    <li><strong>No raw logs stored:</strong> Only the redacted, compressed version of your crash log is stored — the original is never retained.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deduplication:</strong> A non-reversible hash (SHA-256) of your log is computed to avoid storing duplicate files. This hash cannot be used to reconstruct your log.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Redacted logs are stored via Cloudflare Workers and R2 (see Third-Party Services below). Logs are currently retained for for an indefinite period of time.</li>
                    <li><strong>No account required:</strong> Uploads are anonymous. No login, email address, or personal information is collected.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>Third-Party Web Statistics</h2>
                <p>This site uses standard web usage statistic services that may collect data about your visit:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Google Analytics</strong> - <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Microsoft Clarity</strong> - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/clarity/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a></li>
                    <li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> (a Microsoft subsidiary, our open source project hosting provider) - <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a></li>
                </ol>
                <p>We have no control over the data these services collect or how they use it. Please review their privacy policies for details. NOTE: both of these companies are dominant in their industry, and keeping basic usage data from them is probably infeasible anyway.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>This project also relies on the following third-party services. Their own privacy and data practices are beyond the scope of this policy — please review their respective privacy policies on their websites for details:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google Fonts</strong> — Used to load typefaces for the analyzer interface. Google's servers receive a request when the page loads. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Cloudflare Workers &amp; R2</strong> — Used to receive, process, redact, and store crash logs uploaded via the optional MO2 plugin. Cloudflare may log metadata about requests (such as IP addresses) in accordance with their own policies. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a></li>
                    <li><strong>jsDelivr CDN</strong> — Used to load the Turndown JavaScript library (which converts HTML to Markdown). jsDelivr's servers receive a request when the page loads. <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/privacy-policy-jsdelivr-net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Pastebin and other file-sharing services</strong> — When you open a crash log shared via a Pastebin link (or a similar service such as paste.rs), the analyzer retrieves that log from the respective service's servers. We have no control over what data those services collect when your browser contacts them. Please review the privacy policy of whichever service hosted the link you are opening.</li>
                </ul>
