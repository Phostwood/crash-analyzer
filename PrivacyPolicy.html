                <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
                <p>Phostwood's Skyrim Crash Log Analyzer is designed with your privacy in mind. <strong>All crash log analysis happens entirely on your device</strong> — your crash logs never leave your computer or device.</p>
            </section>

                <h2>What We Collect</h2>
                <p><strong>We collect nothing about you personally.</strong> Here's what does happen:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Analysis Only:</strong> Your crash logs are analyzed entirely within your browser. They are never uploaded to any server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crash Log Hashes:</strong> We store a unique identifying number (hash) of each crash log you analyze in your browser's local storage for Google Analytics. This helps us track how many unique crashes each user has analyzed, but the hash contains no personal information and cannot be reversed to reveal your crash log contents.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>No AI Processing of Your Data</h2>
                <p><strong>Your crash logs are never automatically sent to any AI service.</strong> While AI (primarily Claude AI) was used as a development assistant to help write code and troubleshooting instructions, all code was written from our specific instructions and has been manually reviewed and edited by us. Similarly, all troubleshooting instructions began as our rough notes on what to include, were reviewed by us, and often refined in collaboration with Skyrim crash log experts for completeness and accuracy. All AI contributions were made during development only. The final analyzer is static code that runs entirely in your browser — there is no dynamic connection to any AI service, and your crash logs are never transmitted to AI systems for analysis or any other purpose.</p>
                <p>In the future, we may offer an optional feature that allows you to send crash log data to an AI service for additional analysis. Any such feature will be clearly labeled, completely optional, and will require your explicit action to use. We will never send your data to AI services without your knowledge and consent.</p>

                <p>We have no control over the data these services collect or how they use it. Please review their privacy policies for details. NOTE: both of these companies are dominant in their industry, and keeping basic usage data from them is probably infeasible anyway.</p>
